As a result, a malicious user that has access to a jailed system is able to abuse shared memory by injecting malicious content in the shared memory region. This memory region might be executed by applications trusting the shared memory, like Squid. This issue could lead to a Denial of Service or local privilege escalation.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 15:52:44 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2017-11-17", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/101867", "Description": "BID:101867"}, {"URL": "https://www.freebsd.org/security/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-17:09.shm.asc", "Description": "FREEBSD:FreeBSD-SA-17:09"}, {"URL": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1039810", "Description": "SECTRACK:1039810"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2017-11-16"}
