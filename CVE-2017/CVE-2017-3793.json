The vulnerability is due to improper limitation of the global out-of-order TCP queue for specific block sizes. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a large number of unique permitted TCP connections with out-of-order segments. An exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust available blocks in the global out-of-order TCP queue, causing the dropping of any further incoming traffic on all interfaces and resulting in a DoS condition.
