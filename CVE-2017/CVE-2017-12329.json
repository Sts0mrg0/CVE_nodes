The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of command arguments to the CLI parser. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting crafted command arguments into a vulnerable CLI command. An exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands at the user's privilege level. On products that support multiple virtual device contexts (VDCs), this vulnerability could allow the attacker to execute commands at the user's privilege level outside the user's environment. This vulnerability affects the following products running Cisco FXOS or NX-OS System Software: Firepower 4100 Series Next-Generation Firewall, Firepower 9300 Security Appliance, Multilayer Director Switches, Nexus 1000V Series Switches, Nexus 2000 Series Fabric Extenders, Nexus 3000 Series Switches, Nexus 3500 Platform Switches, Nexus 5000 Series Switches, Nexus 5500 Platform Switches, Nexus 5600 Platform Switches, Nexus 6000 Series Switches, Nexus 7000 Series Switches, Nexus 7700 Series Switches, Nexus 9000 Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode, Nexus 9500 R-Series Line Cards and Fabric Modules, Unified Computing System Manager.
