In a ZIP bomb attack, the HTTP server replies with a compressed response that becomes several magnitudes larger once uncompressed. If a client does not take special care when processing such responses, it may result in excessive CPU and/or memory consumption. An attacker might exploit such a weakness for a DoS attack. To exploit this the attacker must control the location (URL) that superagent makes a request to.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 15:52:53 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2018-06-06", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "https://github.com/visionmedia/superagent/issues/1259", "Description": "MISC:https://github.com/visionmedia/superagent/issues/1259"}, {"URL": "https://nodesecurity.io/advisories/479", "Description": "MISC:https://nodesecurity.io/advisories/479"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2018-06-06"}
