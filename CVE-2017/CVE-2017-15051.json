To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker must be first authenticated to the application. For the first one, the attacker has to simply inject XSS code within the URL field of a shared item. For the second one however, the attacker must prepare a payload within its profile, and then ask an administrator to modify its profile. From there, whenever the administrator accesses the log, it can be XSS'ed.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 15:52:52 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2017-11-27", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://blog.amossys.fr/teampass-multiple-cve-01.html", "Description": "MISC:http://blog.amossys.fr/teampass-multiple-cve-01.html"}, {"URL": "https://github.com/nilsteampassnet/TeamPass/commit/5f16f6bb132138ee04eb1e0debf2bdc7d7b7a15f", "Description": "MISC:https://github.com/nilsteampassnet/TeamPass/commit/5f16f6bb132138ee04eb1e0debf2bdc7d7b7a15f"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2017-11-27"}
