This vulnerability occurs as a result of a computation that reads data that is past the end of the target buffer; the computation is a part of Enhanced Metafile Format (EMF) processing within the image conversion module. The use of an invalid (out-of-range) pointer offset during access of internal data structure fields causes the vulnerability. A successful attack can lead to sensitive data exposure.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 15:52:54 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2017-12-13", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/102140", "Description": "BID:102140"}, {"URL": "https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/acrobat/apsb17-36.html", "Description": "CONFIRM:https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/acrobat/apsb17-36.html"}, {"URL": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1039791", "Description": "SECTRACK:1039791"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2017-12-09"}
