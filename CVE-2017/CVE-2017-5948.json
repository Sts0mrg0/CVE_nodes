OxygenOS and HydrogenOS are vulnerable to downgrade attacks. This is due to a lenient 'updater-script' in OTAs that does not check that the current version is lower than or equal to the given image's. Downgrades can occur even on locked bootloaders and without triggering a factory reset, allowing for exploitation of now-patched vulnerabilities with access to user data. This vulnerability can be exploited by a Man-in-the-Middle (MiTM) attacker targeting the update process. This is possible because the update transaction does not occur over TLS (CVE-2016-10370). In addition, a physical attacker can reboot the phone into recovery, and then use 'adb sideload' to push the OTA (on OnePlus 3/3T 'Secure Start-up' must be off).", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 15:53:06 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2017-05-11", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "https://alephsecurity.com/vulns/aleph-2017008", "Description": "MISC:https://alephsecurity.com/vulns/aleph-2017008"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2017-05-11"}
