An attacker can change the plant time even when not authenticated in any way. This changes the system time, possibly affecting lockout policies and random-number generators based on timestamps, and makes timestamps for data analysis unreliable. NOTE: the vendor reports that this is largely irrelevant because it only affects log-entry timestamps, and because the plant time would later be reset via NTP. (It has never been the case that a lockout policy or random-number generator was affected.) Also, only Sunny Boy TLST-21 and TL-21 and Sunny Tripower TL-10 and TL-30 could potentially be affected.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 15:53:13 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2017-08-21", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.sma.de/en/statement-on-cyber-security.html", "Description": "MISC:http://www.sma.de/en/statement-on-cyber-security.html"}, {"URL": "http://www.sma.de/fileadmin/content/global/specials/documents/cyber-security/Whitepaper-Cyber-Security-AEN1732_07.pdf", "Description": "MISC:http://www.sma.de/fileadmin/content/global/specials/documents/cyber-security/Whitepaper-Cyber-Security-AEN1732_07.pdf"}, {"URL": "https://horusscenario.com/CVE-information/", "Description": "MISC:https://horusscenario.com/CVE-information/"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2017-08-05"}
