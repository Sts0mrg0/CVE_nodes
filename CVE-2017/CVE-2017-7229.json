The outcome is that encrypted mail passing through this device does not work (Denial of Service), and a common real-world consequence is a request to resend the mail in the clear (Information Disclosure).", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 15:53:08 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2017-05-03", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "https://gist.github.com/dkg/a1998c861bf2430e0d01d586905b11cb", "Description": "MISC:https://gist.github.com/dkg/a1998c861bf2430e0d01d586905b11cb"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2017-05-03"}
