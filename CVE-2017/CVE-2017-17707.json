To perform those actions on an entry, the user needs to know the corresponding \"CredentialId\" value, which uniquely identifies a password safe entry. Since \"CredentialId\" values are implemented as GUIDs, they are hard to guess. However, if for example an entry's owner grants read-only access to a malicious user, the value gets exposed to the malicious user.
