An attacker takes advantage of this scenario and creates a crafted CSRF link to add himself as an administrator to the ZKTime Web Software. He then uses social engineering methods to trick the administrator into clicking the forged HTTP request. The request is executed and the attacker becomes the Administrator of the ZKTime Web Software. If the vulnerability is successfully exploited, then an attacker (who would be a normal user of the web application) can escalate his privileges and become the administrator of ZKTime Web Software.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 15:52:55 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2017-12-04", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/102007", "Description": "BID:102007"}, {"URL": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/145160/ZKTeco-ZKTime-Web-2.0.1.12280-Cross-Site-Request-Forgery.html", "Description": "MISC:http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/145160/ZKTeco-ZKTime-Web-2.0.1.12280-Cross-Site-Request-Forgery.html"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2017-12-04"}
