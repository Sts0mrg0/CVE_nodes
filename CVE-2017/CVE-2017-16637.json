Although the mechanism malfunctions and an error occurs during the runtime with the stack trace being issued, the software process is not properly terminated. The software client is still attempting to maintain the connection even though the network connection information is being reset live. In that insecure mode, the \"FrmAdvancedProtection\" component crashes, but the process continues to run with different errors and process corruptions. This local corruption vulnerability can be exploited by local attackers.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 15:52:54 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2017-11-06", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "https://board.perfect-privacy.com/threads/reporting-a-security-bug-in-vpn-software-client-for-windows.2223/", "Description": "MISC:https://board.perfect-privacy.com/threads/reporting-a-security-bug-in-vpn-software-client-for-windows.2223/"}, {"URL": "https://www.vulnerability-lab.com/get_content.php?id=2102", "Description": "MISC:https://www.vulnerability-lab.com/get_content.php?id=2102"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2017-11-06"}
