Dahua IP camera products include an application known as Sonia (/usr/bin/sonia) that provides the web interface and other services for controlling the IP camera remotely. Versions of Sonia included in firmware versions prior to DH_IPC-Consumer-Zi-Themis_Eng_P_V2.408.0000.11.R.20170621 do not validate input data length for the 'password' field of the web interface. A remote, unauthenticated attacker may submit a crafted POST request to the IP camera's Sonia web interface that may lead to out-of-bounds memory operations and loss of availability or remote code execution. The issue was originally identified by the researcher in firmware version DH_IPC-HX1X2X-Themis_EngSpnFrn_N_V2.400.0000.30.R.20160803.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 15:53:01 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2018-07-25", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/99620", "Description": "BID:99620"}, {"URL": "https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/547255", "Description": "CERT-VN:VU#547255"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2018-07-24"}
