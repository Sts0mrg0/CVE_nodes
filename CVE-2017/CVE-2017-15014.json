As the result of this design, any authenticated user may create his own dmr_content object, pointing to already existing content in the Content Server filesystem.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 15:52:51 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2017-11-02", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/101639", "Description": "BID:101639"}, {"URL": "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/43005/", "Description": "EXPLOIT-DB:43005"}, {"URL": "http://seclists.org/bugtraq/2017/Oct/19", "Description": "MISC:http://seclists.org/bugtraq/2017/Oct/19"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2017-10-13"}
