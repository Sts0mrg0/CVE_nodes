Then, the attacker can put the platform's SELinux in permissive mode, which severely weakens it, by issuing: fastboot oem selinux permissive.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 15:53:05 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2017-01-24", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/95706", "Description": "BID:95706"}, {"URL": "https://securityresear.ch/2017/01/11/fastboot-oem-selinux-permissive/", "Description": "MISC:https://securityresear.ch/2017/01/11/fastboot-oem-selinux-permissive/"}, {"URL": "https://www.xda-developers.com/oneplus-33t-bootloader-vulnerability-allows-changing-of-selinux-to-permissive-mode-in-fastboot/", "Description": "MISC:https://www.xda-developers.com/oneplus-33t-bootloader-vulnerability-allows-changing-of-selinux-to-permissive-mode-in-fastboot/"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2017-01-23"}
