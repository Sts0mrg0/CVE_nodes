If you have implemented a Settings Tray form in contrib or a custom module, the correct access checks should be added. This release fixes the only two implementations in core, but does not harden against other such bypasses. This vulnerability can be mitigated by disabling the Settings Tray module.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 15:53:08 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2018-03-01", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "https://www.drupal.org/sa-core-2018-001", "Description": "CONFIRM:https://www.drupal.org/sa-core-2018-001"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2018-03-01"}
