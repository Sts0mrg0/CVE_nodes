This account can be accessed via both the web interface and SSH. In the web interface, this simply grants an attacker read-only access to the device's settings. However, when using SSH, this gives an attacker access to a Linux shell. NOTE: the vendor has commented \"The mateidu user is a known user, which is mentioned in the FibeAir IP-10 User Guide. Customers are instructed to change the mateidu user password. Changing the user password fully solves the vulnerability.\"", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 15:53:12 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2017-06-01", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://blog.iancaling.com/post/160817658078", "Description": "MISC:http://blog.iancaling.com/post/160817658078"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2017-05-21"}
