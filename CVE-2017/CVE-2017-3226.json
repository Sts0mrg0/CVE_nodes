Devices that make use of Das U-Boot's AES-CBC encryption feature using environment encryption (i.e., setting the configuration parameter CONFIG_ENV_AES=y) read environment variables from disk as the encrypted disk image is processed. An attacker with physical access to the device can manipulate the encrypted environment data to include a crafted two-byte sequence which triggers an error in environment variable parsing. This error condition is improperly handled by Das U-Boot, resulting in an immediate process termination with a debugging message.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 15:53:01 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2018-07-25", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/100675", "Description": "BID:100675"}, {"URL": "https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/166743", "Description": "CERT-VN:VU#166743"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2018-07-24"}
