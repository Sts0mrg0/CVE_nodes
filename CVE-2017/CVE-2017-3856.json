The vulnerability is due to insufficient resource handling by the affected software when the web user interface is under a high load. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a high number of requests to the web user interface of the affected software. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have access to the management interface of the affected software, which is typically connected to a restricted management network. This vulnerability affects Cisco devices that are running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS XE Software, if the web user interface of the software is enabled. By default, the web user interface is not enabled.
