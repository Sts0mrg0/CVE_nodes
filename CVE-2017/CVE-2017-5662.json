The file types that can be shown depend on the user context in which the exploitable application is running. If the user is root a full compromise of the server - including confidential or sensitive files - would be possible. XXE can also be used to attack the availability of the server via denial of service as the references within a xml document can trivially trigger an amplification attack.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 15:53:06 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2018-07-18", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/97948", "Description": "BID:97948"}, {"URL": "http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpuapr2018-3678067.html", "Description": "CONFIRM:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpuapr2018-3678067.html"}, {"URL": "http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpujul2018-4258247.html", "Description": "CONFIRM:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpujul2018-4258247.html"}, {"URL": "http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpuoct2017-3236626.html", "Description": "CONFIRM:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpuoct2017-3236626.html"}, {"URL": "https://xmlgraphics.apache.org/security.html", "Description": "CONFIRM:https://xmlgraphics.apache.org/security.html"}, {"URL": "https://www.debian.org/security/2018/dsa-4215", "Description": "DEBIAN:DSA-4215"}, {"URL": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:2546", "Description": "REDHAT:RHSA-2017:2546"}, {"URL": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:2547", "Description": "REDHAT:RHSA-2017:2547"}, {"URL": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:0319", "Description": "REDHAT:RHSA-2018:0319"}, {"URL": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1038334", "Description": "SECTRACK:1038334"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2017-04-18"}
