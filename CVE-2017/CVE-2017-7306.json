NOTE: the vendor believes that this does not meet the definition of a vulnerability. The product contains correct computational logic for supporting arbitrary password changes by customers; however, a password change is optional to meet different customers' needs.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 15:53:09 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2017-04-04", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2017/Feb/25", "Description": "MISC:http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2017/Feb/25"}, {"URL": "https://supportkb.riverbed.com/support/index?page=content&id=S30065", "Description": "MISC:https://supportkb.riverbed.com/support/index?page=content&id=S30065"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2017-04-04"}
