Given the following situation: the Crowd application is bound to directory 1 and has a user called admin and the Google Apps application is bound to directory 2, which also has a user called admin, it was possible to authenticate REST requests using the credentials of the user coming from directory 2 and impersonate the user from directory 1.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 15:52:55 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2018-01-31", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CWD-5009", "Description": "CONFIRM:https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CWD-5009"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2018-01-31"}
