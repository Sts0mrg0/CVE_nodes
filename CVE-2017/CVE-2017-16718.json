ADS is a protocol for industrial automation in protected environments. This protocol uses user configured routes, that can be edited remotely via ADS. This special command supports encrypted authentication with username/password. The encryption uses a fixed key, that could be extracted by an attacker. Precondition of the exploitation of this weakness is network access at the moment a route is added.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 15:52:55 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2018-06-27", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "https://download.beckhoff.com/download/Document/product-security/Advisories/advisory-2017-002.pdf", "Description": "MISC:https://download.beckhoff.com/download/Document/product-security/Advisories/advisory-2017-002.pdf"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2018-06-27"}
