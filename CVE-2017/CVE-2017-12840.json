The vulnerability is present due to the kernel driver failing to allocate sufficient memory on the kernel heap to contain a user supplied string as such the string is copied into a buffer of constant size (0x1000-bytes) and thus an overflow condition results. Access to the kernel driver is permitted through an obfuscated interface whereby bytes of user supplied message are \"authenticated\" via an obfuscation routine employing a linear equation.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 15:52:48 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2017-08-28", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "https://www.trustwave.com/Resources/Security-Advisories/Advisories/TWSL2017-016/?fid=9946", "Description": "MISC:https://www.trustwave.com/Resources/Security-Advisories/Advisories/TWSL2017-016/?fid=9946"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2017-08-28"}
