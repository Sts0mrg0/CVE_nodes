In this state, the central monitoring station can indicate the MX40 is not connected or associated to the central monitor, and thus should be operating in local monitoring mode (local audio-on, screen-on), but the MX40 WLAN itself can instead still be operating in telemetry mode (local audio-off, screen-off). If a patient experiences an alarm event and clinical staff expects the MX40 to provide local alarming when it is not available from the local device, a delay of treatment can occur. CVSS v3 base score: 6.5, CVSS vector string: AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H. Philips has released software update, Version B.06.18, to fix the improper cleanup on thrown exception vulnerability, and implement mitigations to reduce the risk associated with the improper handling of exceptional conditions vulnerability. The software update implements messaging and alarming on the MX40 and at the central monitoring station, when the MX40 disconnects from the access point.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 15:53:13 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2018-05-01", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/100813", "Description": "BID:100813"}, {"URL": "https://www.usa.philips.com/healthcare/about/customer-support/product-security", "Description": "CONFIRM:https://www.usa.philips.com/healthcare/about/customer-support/product-security"}, {"URL": "https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/advisories/ICSMA-17-255-01", "Description": "MISC:https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/advisories/ICSMA-17-255-01"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2018-04-30"}
