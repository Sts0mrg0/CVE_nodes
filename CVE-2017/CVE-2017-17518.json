NOTE: This issue is being disputed as not being a vulnerability because \u201cthe current version of white_dune (1.369 at https://wdune.ourproject.org/) do not use a \"BROWSER environment variable\". Instead, the \"browser\" variable is read from the $HOME/.dunerc file (or from the M$Windows registry). It is configurable in the \"options\" menu. The default is chosen in the ./configure script, which tests various programs, first tested is \"xdg-open\".\u201d", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 15:52:56 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-09-26", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-17518", "Description": "MISC:https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-17518"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2017-12-14"}
