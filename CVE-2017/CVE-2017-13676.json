These types of issues occur when an application looks to call a DLL for execution and an attacker provides a malicious DLL to use instead. Depending on how the application is configured, it will generally follow a specific search path to locate the DLL. The vulnerability can be exploited by a simple file write (or potentially an over-write) which results in a foreign DLL running under the context of the application. A Norton Remove & Reinstall update, version 4.4.0.58, has been released which addresses the aforementioned vulnerability.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 15:52:49 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2017-09-28", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/100939", "Description": "BID:100939"}, {"URL": "https://www.symantec.com/security_response/securityupdates/detail.jsp?fid=security_advisory&pvid=security_advisory&year=&suid=20170926_00", "Description": "CONFIRM:https://www.symantec.com/security_response/securityupdates/detail.jsp?fid=security_advisory&pvid=security_advisory&year=&suid=20170926_00"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2017-09-27"}
