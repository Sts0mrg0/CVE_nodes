This issue is due to an untrusted pointer dereference when handling number format dictionary entries. In this scenario, the input is crafted in way that the computation results in pointers to memory locations that do not belong to the relevant process address space. The dereferencing operation is a read operation, and an attack can result in sensitive data exposure.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 15:52:54 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2017-12-09", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/101813", "Description": "BID:101813"}, {"URL": "https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/acrobat/apsb17-36.html", "Description": "CONFIRM:https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/acrobat/apsb17-36.html"}, {"URL": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1039791", "Description": "SECTRACK:1039791"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2017-12-09"}
