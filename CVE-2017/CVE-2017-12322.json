The vulnerabilities are due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of the affected service. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by persuading a user to click a malicious link or by sending an HTTP request that could cause the affected service to redirect the request to a specified malicious URL. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the web interface of the affected system or allow the attacker to access sensitive browser-based information on the affected system. These types of exploits could also be used in phishing attacks that send users to malicious websites without their knowledge.
