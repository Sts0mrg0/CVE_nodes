The binary orthrus in /sbin folder of the device handles all the UPnP connections received by the device. It seems that the binary performs a sprintf operation at address 0x0000A3E4 with the value in the command line parameter \"-f\" and stores it on the stack. Since there is no length check, this results in corrupting the registers for the function sub_A098 which results in memory corruption.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 15:53:10 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-07-02", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/Jun/8", "Description": "BUGTRAQ:20190609 Newly releases IoT security issues"}, {"URL": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/153226/Dlink-DCS-1130-Command-Injection-CSRF-Stack-Overflow.html", "Description": "MISC:http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/153226/Dlink-DCS-1130-Command-Injection-CSRF-Stack-Overflow.html"}, {"URL": "https://github.com/ethanhunnt/IoT_vulnerabilities/blob/master/Dlink_DCS_1130_security.pdf", "Description": "MISC:https://github.com/ethanhunnt/IoT_vulnerabilities/blob/master/Dlink_DCS_1130_security.pdf"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-07-02"}
