However, since the default URI is not using https, it is vulnerable to a MiTM and the Gradle executable is not safe. The severity of this issue is high due to the fact that the build scripts immediately start a build after Gradle has been fetched. Developers who are concerned about this issue should install version 6.1.2 or higher of Cordova-Android. If developers are unable to install the latest version, this vulnerability can easily be mitigated by setting the CORDOVA_ANDROID_GRADLE_DISTRIBUTION_URL environment variable to https://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-2.14.1-all.zip", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 15:53:01 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2018-02-02", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/95838", "Description": "BID:95838"}, {"URL": "https://cordova.apache.org/announcements/2017/01/27/android-612.html", "Description": "MISC:https://cordova.apache.org/announcements/2017/01/27/android-612.html"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2018-02-01"}
