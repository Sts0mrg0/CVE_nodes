To exploit the vulnerability, a remote, unauthenticated attacker has to capture TLS traffic between clients and the affected products. The attacker may launch the Bleichenbacher attack on RSA key exchange to decrypt the session key and the previously captured sessions by some cryptanalytic operations. Successful exploit may cause information leak.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 15:52:55 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2018-07-31", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.huawei.com/en/psirt/security-advisories/huawei-sa-20180703-01-algorithm-en", "Description": "CONFIRM:http://www.huawei.com/en/psirt/security-advisories/huawei-sa-20180703-01-algorithm-en"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2018-07-31"}
