If the default protocol is specified to be FILE or a file: URL lacks two slashes, the given \"URL\" starts with a drive letter, and libcurl is built for Windows or DOS, then libcurl would copy the path 7 bytes off, so that the end of the given path would write beyond the malloc buffer (7 bytes being the length in bytes of the ascii string \"file://\").", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 15:53:12 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2017-07-07", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/99120", "Description": "BID:99120"}, {"URL": "http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2017/06/14/1", "Description": "CONFIRM:http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2017/06/14/1"}, {"URL": "https://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20170614.html", "Description": "CONFIRM:https://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20170614.html"}, {"URL": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1038697", "Description": "SECTRACK:1038697"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2017-06-14"}
