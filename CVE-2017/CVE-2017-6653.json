The vulnerability is due to insufficient TCP rate limiting protection on the GUI. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending the affected device a high rate of TCP connections to the GUI. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the GUI to stop responding while the high rate of connections is in progress.
