An unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability allowed attackers to transfer a serialized Java `SignedObject` object to the Jenkins CLI, that would be deserialized using a new `ObjectInputStream`, bypassing the existing blacklist-based protection mechanism. We're fixing this issue by adding `SignedObject` to the blacklist. We're also backporting the new HTTP CLI protocol from Jenkins 2.54 to LTS 2.46.2, and deprecating the remoting-based (i.e. Java serialization) CLI protocol, disabling it by default.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 15:52:42 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2018-01-30", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/98056", "Description": "BID:98056"}, {"URL": "https://jenkins.io/security/advisory/2017-04-26/", "Description": "CONFIRM:https://jenkins.io/security/advisory/2017-04-26/"}, {"URL": "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/41965/", "Description": "EXPLOIT-DB:41965"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2018-01-29"}
