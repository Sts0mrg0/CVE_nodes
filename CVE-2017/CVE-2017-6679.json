To address this vulnerability, the Umbrella Virtual Appliance version 2.1.0 now requires explicit customer approval before an SSH tunnel from the VA to the Cisco terminating server can be established.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 15:53:07 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2017-12-04", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/101567", "Description": "BID:101567"}, {"URL": "https://support.umbrella.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004154423", "Description": "MISC:https://support.umbrella.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004154423"}, {"URL": "https://support.umbrella.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004752143-Virtual-Appliance-Vulnerability-due-to-always-on-SSH-Tunnel-RESOLVED-2017-09-15", "Description": "MISC:https://support.umbrella.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004752143-Virtual-Appliance-Vulnerability-due-to-always-on-SSH-Tunnel-RESOLVED-2017-09-15"}, {"URL": "https://www.info-sec.ca/advisories/Cisco-Umbrella.html", "Description": "MISC:https://www.info-sec.ca/advisories/Cisco-Umbrella.html"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2017-12-01"}
