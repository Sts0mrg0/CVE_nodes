This new issue is analogous to previously disclosed CVE-2016-8655. In both cases, a socket option that changes socket state may race with safety checks in packet_set_ring. Previously with PACKET_VERSION. This time with PACKET_RESERVE. The solution is similar: lock the socket for the update. This issue may be exploitable, we did not investigate further. As this issue affects PF_PACKET sockets, it requires CAP_NET_RAW in the process namespace. But note that with user namespaces enabled, any process can create a namespace in which it has CAP_NET_RAW.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 15:52:42 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2017-12-06", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/100267", "Description": "BID:100267"}, {"URL": "https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2017-1000111", "Description": "CONFIRM:https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2017-1000111"}, {"URL": "http://www.debian.org/security/2017/dsa-3981", "Description": "DEBIAN:DSA-3981"}, {"URL": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:2918", "Description": "REDHAT:RHSA-2017:2918"}, {"URL": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:2930", "Description": "REDHAT:RHSA-2017:2930"}, {"URL": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:2931", "Description": "REDHAT:RHSA-2017:2931"}, {"URL": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:3200", "Description": "REDHAT:RHSA-2017:3200"}, {"URL": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1039132", "Description": "SECTRACK:1039132"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2017-10-03"}
