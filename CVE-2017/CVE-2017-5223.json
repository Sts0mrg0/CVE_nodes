PHPMailer's msgHTML method applies transformations to an HTML document to make it usable as an email message body. One of the transformations is to convert relative image URLs into attachments using a script-provided base directory. If no base directory is provided, it resolves to /, meaning that relative image URLs get treated as absolute local file paths and added as attachments. To form a remote vulnerability, the msgHTML method must be called, passed an unfiltered, user-supplied HTML document, and must not set a base directory.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 15:53:05 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2017-10-27", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/95328", "Description": "BID:95328"}, {"URL": "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/43056/", "Description": "EXPLOIT-DB:43056"}, {"URL": "http://kalilinux.co/2017/01/12/phpmailer-cve-2017-5223-local-information-disclosure-vulnerability-analysis/", "Description": "MISC:http://kalilinux.co/2017/01/12/phpmailer-cve-2017-5223-local-information-disclosure-vulnerability-analysis/"}, {"URL": "https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/blob/master/SECURITY.md", "Description": "MISC:https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/blob/master/SECURITY.md"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2017-01-16"}
