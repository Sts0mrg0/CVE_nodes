In _krb5_extract_ticket() the KDC-REP service name must be obtained from the encrypted version stored in 'enc_part' instead of the unencrypted version stored in 'ticket'. Use of the unencrypted version provides an opportunity for successful server impersonation and other attacks. NOTE: this CVE is only for Heimdal and other products that embed Heimdal code; it does not apply to other instances in which this part of the Kerberos 5 protocol specification is violated.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 15:52:44 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2017-11-20", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/99551", "Description": "BID:99551"}, {"URL": "http://www.h5l.org/advisories.html?show=2017-07-11", "Description": "CONFIRM:http://www.h5l.org/advisories.html?show=2017-07-11"}, {"URL": "https://github.com/heimdal/heimdal/releases/tag/heimdal-7.4.0", "Description": "CONFIRM:https://github.com/heimdal/heimdal/releases/tag/heimdal-7.4.0"}, {"URL": "https://support.apple.com/HT208112", "Description": "CONFIRM:https://support.apple.com/HT208112"}, {"URL": "https://support.apple.com/HT208144", "Description": "CONFIRM:https://support.apple.com/HT208144"}, {"URL": "https://support.apple.com/HT208221", "Description": "CONFIRM:https://support.apple.com/HT208221"}, {"URL": "https://www.samba.org/samba/security/CVE-2017-11103.html", "Description": "CONFIRM:https://www.samba.org/samba/security/CVE-2017-11103.html"}, {"URL": "http://www.debian.org/security/2017/dsa-3912", "Description": "DEBIAN:DSA-3912"}, {"URL": "https://www.freebsd.org/security/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-17:05.heimdal.asc", "Description": "FREEBSD:FreeBSD-SA-17:05"}, {"URL": "https://www.orpheus-lyre.info/", "Description": "MISC:https://www.orpheus-lyre.info/"}, {"URL": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1038876", "Description": "SECTRACK:1038876"}, {"URL": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1039427", "Description": "SECTRACK:1039427"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2017-07-13"}
