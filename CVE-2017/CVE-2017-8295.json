This is related to problematic use of the SERVER_NAME variable in wp-includes/pluggable.php in conjunction with the PHP mail function. Exploitation is not achievable in all cases because it requires at least one of the following: (1) the attacker can prevent the victim from receiving any e-mail messages for an extended period of time (such as 5 days), (2) the victim's e-mail system sends an autoresponse containing the original message, or (3) the victim manually composes a reply containing the original message.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 15:53:10 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2017-11-03", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/98295", "Description": "BID:98295"}, {"URL": "http://www.debian.org/security/2017/dsa-3870", "Description": "DEBIAN:DSA-3870"}, {"URL": "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/41963/", "Description": "EXPLOIT-DB:41963"}, {"URL": "https://exploitbox.io/vuln/WordPress-Exploit-4-7-Unauth-Password-Reset-0day-CVE-2017-8295.html", "Description": "MISC:https://exploitbox.io/vuln/WordPress-Exploit-4-7-Unauth-Password-Reset-0day-CVE-2017-8295.html"}, {"URL": "https://wpvulndb.com/vulnerabilities/8807", "Description": "MISC:https://wpvulndb.com/vulnerabilities/8807"}, {"URL": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1038403", "Description": "SECTRACK:1038403"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2017-05-04"}
