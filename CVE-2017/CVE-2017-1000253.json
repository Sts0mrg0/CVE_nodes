This kernel vulnerability was fixed in April 2015 by commit a87938b2e246b81b4fb713edb371a9fa3c5c3c86 (backported to Linux 3.10.77 in May 2015), but it was not recognized as a security threat. With CONFIG_ARCH_BINFMT_ELF_RANDOMIZE_PIE enabled, and a normal top-down address allocation strategy, load_elf_binary() will attempt to map a PIE binary into an address range immediately below mm->mmap_base. Unfortunately, load_elf_ binary() does not take account of the need to allocate sufficient space for the entire binary which means that, while the first PT_LOAD segment is mapped below mm->mmap_base, the subsequent PT_LOAD segment(s) end up being mapped above mm->mmap_base into the are that is supposed to be the \"gap\" between the stack and the binary.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 15:52:42 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2017-12-08", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/101010", "Description": "BID:101010"}, {"URL": "https://www.qualys.com/2017/09/26/cve-2017-1000253/cve-2017-1000253.txt", "Description": "MISC:https://www.qualys.com/2017/09/26/cve-2017-1000253/cve-2017-1000253.txt"}, {"URL": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:2793", "Description": "REDHAT:RHSA-2017:2793"}, {"URL": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:2794", "Description": "REDHAT:RHSA-2017:2794"}, {"URL": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:2795", "Description": "REDHAT:RHSA-2017:2795"}, {"URL": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:2796", "Description": "REDHAT:RHSA-2017:2796"}, {"URL": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:2797", "Description": "REDHAT:RHSA-2017:2797"}, {"URL": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:2798", "Description": "REDHAT:RHSA-2017:2798"}, {"URL": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:2799", "Description": "REDHAT:RHSA-2017:2799"}, {"URL": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:2800", "Description": "REDHAT:RHSA-2017:2800"}, {"URL": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:2801", "Description": "REDHAT:RHSA-2017:2801"}, {"URL": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:2802", "Description": "REDHAT:RHSA-2017:2802"}, {"URL": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1039434", "Description": "SECTRACK:1039434"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2017-10-03"}
