One perspective on this issue is that (1) these products do not use the Protected Processes feature, and therefore an attacker can enter an arbitrary Application Verifier Provider DLL under Image File Execution Options in the registry; (2) the self-protection mechanism is intended to block all local processes (regardless of privileges) from modifying Image File Execution Options for these products; and (3) this mechanism can be bypassed by an attacker who temporarily renames Image File Execution Options during the attack.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 15:53:05 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2017-07-10", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/97031", "Description": "BID:97031"}, {"URL": "http://cybellum.com/doubleagent-taking-full-control-antivirus/", "Description": "MISC:http://cybellum.com/doubleagent-taking-full-control-antivirus/"}, {"URL": "http://cybellum.com/doubleagentzero-day-code-injection-and-persistence-technique/", "Description": "MISC:http://cybellum.com/doubleagentzero-day-code-injection-and-persistence-technique/"}, {"URL": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1038206", "Description": "SECTRACK:1038206"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2017-03-21"}
