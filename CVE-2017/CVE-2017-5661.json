The file types that can be shown depend on the user context in which the exploitable application is running. If the user is root a full compromise of the server - including confidential or sensitive files - would be possible. XXE can also be used to attack the availability of the server via denial of service as the references within a xml document can trivially trigger an amplification attack.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 15:53:06 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2017-11-03", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/97947", "Description": "BID:97947"}, {"URL": "https://xmlgraphics.apache.org/security.html", "Description": "CONFIRM:https://xmlgraphics.apache.org/security.html"}, {"URL": "http://www.debian.org/security/2017/dsa-3864", "Description": "DEBIAN:DSA-3864"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2017-04-18"}
