Successful exploitation of this issue could result in remote code execution in a virtual machine via the authenticated VNC session. Note: In order for exploitation to be possible in ESXi, VNC must be manually enabled in a virtual machine's .vmx configuration file. In addition, ESXi must be configured to allow VNC traffic through the built-in firewall.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 15:53:04 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2017-12-21", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2017-0021.html", "Description": "CONFIRM:https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2017-0021.html"}, {"URL": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1040024", "Description": "SECTRACK:1040024"}, {"URL": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1040025", "Description": "SECTRACK:1040025"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2017-12-20"}
