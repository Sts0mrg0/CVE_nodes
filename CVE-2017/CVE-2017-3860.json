These vulnerabilities are due to improper parsing of crafted EnergyWise packets destined to an affected device. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending crafted EnergyWise packets to be processed by an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a buffer overflow condition or a reload of the affected device, leading to a DoS condition. Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software support EnergyWise for IPv4 communication. Only IPv4 packets destined to a device configured as an EnergyWise domain member can trigger these vulnerabilities. IPv6 packets cannot be used to trigger these vulnerabilities.
