The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of user-supplied application packages. An attacker who can upload a malicious package within Cisco IOx could exploit the vulnerability to modify arbitrary files. The impacts of a successful exploit are limited to the scope of the virtual instance and do not impact the router that is hosting Cisco IOx. Cisco IOx Releases 1.0.0.0 and 1.1.0.0 are vulnerable.
