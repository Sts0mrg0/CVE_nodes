The attacker still needs valid credentials with the authentication provider on the spoofed port. This becomes an issue when the spoofed port has weaker authentication protection (e.g., anonymous access, default accounts) and is normally protected by firewall rules or similar which can be circumvented by this vulnerability. AMQP ports are not affected. Versions 6.0.0 and newer are not affected.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 15:52:53 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2017-12-06", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/102040", "Description": "BID:102040"}, {"URL": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/QPID-8039", "Description": "CONFIRM:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/QPID-8039"}, {"URL": "https://qpid.apache.org/cves/CVE-2017-15702.html", "Description": "CONFIRM:https://qpid.apache.org/cves/CVE-2017-15702.html"}, {"URL": "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/59d241e30db23b8b0af26bb273f789aa1f08515d3dc1a3868d3ba090@%3Cdev.qpid.apache.org%3E", "Description": "MLIST:[dev] 20171130 [SECURITY] [CVE-2017-15702] Apache Qpid Broker-J Authentication Vulnerability on HTTP Ports"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2017-12-01"}
