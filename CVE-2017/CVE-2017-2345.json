Repeated crashes of the snmpd daemon can result in a partial denial of service condition. Additionally, it may be possible to craft a malicious SNMP packet in a way that can result in remote code execution. SNMP is disabled in Junos OS by default. Junos OS devices with SNMP disabled are not affected by this issue. No other Juniper Networks products or platforms are affected by this issue.
