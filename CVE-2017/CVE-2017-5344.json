The findChildrenByFilter() function which is called by the web accessible path /categoriesServlet performs string interpolation and direct SQL query execution. SQL quote escaping and a keyword blacklist were implemented in a new class, SQLUtil (main/java/com/dotmarketing/common/util/SQLUtil.java), as part of the remediation of CVE-2016-8902; however, these can be overcome in the case of the q and inode parameters to the /categoriesServlet path. Overcoming these controls permits a number of blind boolean SQL injection vectors in either parameter. The /categoriesServlet web path can be accessed remotely and without authentication in a default dotCMS deployment.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 15:53:05 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2017-08-31", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/96259", "Description": "BID:96259"}, {"URL": "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/41377/", "Description": "EXPLOIT-DB:41377"}, {"URL": "http://dotcms.com/security/SI-39", "Description": "MISC:http://dotcms.com/security/SI-39"}, {"URL": "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2017/Feb/34", "Description": "MISC:http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2017/Feb/34"}, {"URL": "https://github.com/xdrr/webapp-exploits/blob/master/vendors/dotcms/2017.01.blind-sqli/dotcms-dump.sh", "Description": "MISC:https://github.com/xdrr/webapp-exploits/blob/master/vendors/dotcms/2017.01.blind-sqli/dotcms-dump.sh"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2017-02-17"}
