These versions contain a system account that is installed by default. The default system account is difficult to configure with non-default credentials after installation, and changing the default credentials in the embedded Tableau Server is not documented. If Tableau Server is used with Windows integrated security (Active Directory), the software is not vulnerable. However, when Tableau Server is used with local authentication mode, the software is vulnerable. The default system account could be used to gain unauthorized access.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 15:53:05 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2017-03-09", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/96721", "Description": "BID:96721"}, {"URL": "http://software.schneider-electric.com/pdf/security-bulletin/lfsec00000119/", "Description": "CONFIRM:http://software.schneider-electric.com/pdf/security-bulletin/lfsec00000119/"}, {"URL": "https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/advisories/ICSA-17-066-01", "Description": "MISC:https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/advisories/ICSA-17-066-01"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2017-03-08"}
