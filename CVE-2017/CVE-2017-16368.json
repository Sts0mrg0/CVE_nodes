This vulnerability leads to a stack-based buffer overflow condition in the internal Unicode string manipulation module. It is triggered by an invalid PDF file, where a crafted Unicode string causes an out of bounds memory access of a stack allocated buffer, due to improper checks when manipulating an offset of a pointer to the buffer. Attackers can exploit the vulnerability and achieve arbitrary code execution if they can effectively control the accessible memory.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 15:52:54 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2017-12-09", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/101816", "Description": "BID:101816"}, {"URL": "https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/acrobat/apsb17-36.html", "Description": "CONFIRM:https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/acrobat/apsb17-36.html"}, {"URL": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1039791", "Description": "SECTRACK:1039791"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2017-12-09"}
