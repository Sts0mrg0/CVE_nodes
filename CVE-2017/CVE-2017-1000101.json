In the globbing function that parses the numerical range, there was an omission that made curl read a byte beyond the end of the URL if given a carefully crafted, or just wrongly written, URL. The URL is stored in a heap based buffer, so it could then be made to wrongly read something else instead of crashing. An example of a URL that triggers the flaw would be `http://ur%20[0-60000000000000000000`.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 15:52:42 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2018-11-13", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/100249", "Description": "BID:100249"}, {"URL": "https://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20170809A.html", "Description": "CONFIRM:https://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20170809A.html"}, {"URL": "https://support.apple.com/HT208221", "Description": "CONFIRM:https://support.apple.com/HT208221"}, {"URL": "http://www.debian.org/security/2017/dsa-3992", "Description": "DEBIAN:DSA-3992"}, {"URL": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201709-14", "Description": "GENTOO:GLSA-201709-14"}, {"URL": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:3558", "Description": "REDHAT:RHSA-2018:3558"}, {"URL": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1039117", "Description": "SECTRACK:1039117"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2017-10-03"}
