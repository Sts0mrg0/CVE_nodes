As the process is running as \"root\" full control over the device can be acquired. IPv6 is also left in auto-configuration mode, accepting router advertisements automatically and assigns a MAC address based IPv6 address.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 15:53:09 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2017-09-11", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=514681", "Description": "CONFIRM:https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=514681"}, {"URL": "https://github.com/eclipse/kura/issues/956", "Description": "CONFIRM:https://github.com/eclipse/kura/issues/956"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2017-09-11"}
