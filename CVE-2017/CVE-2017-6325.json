This issue is caused when an application builds a path to executable code using an attacker-controlled variable in a way that allows the attacker to control which file is executed at run time. This file inclusion vulnerability subverts how an application loads code for execution. Successful exploitation of a file inclusion vulnerability will result in remote code execution on the web server that runs the affected web application.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 15:53:07 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2017-07-06", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/98890", "Description": "BID:98890"}, {"URL": "https://www.symantec.com/security_response/securityupdates/detail.jsp?fid=security_advisory&pvid=security_advisory&year=&suid=20170621_00", "Description": "CONFIRM:https://www.symantec.com/security_response/securityupdates/detail.jsp?fid=security_advisory&pvid=security_advisory&year=&suid=20170621_00"}, {"URL": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1038785", "Description": "SECTRACK:1038785"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2017-06-26"}
