Because HTTPS communications are terminated at the gorouter, communications from the gorouter to GemFire clusters are unencrypted. An attacker could run any command available on gfsh and could cause denial of service, lost confidentiality of data, escalate privileges, or eavesdrop on other communications between the gorouter and the cluster.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:01:53 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2017-01-09", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/95270", "Description": "BID:95270"}, {"URL": "https://pivotal.io/security/cve-2016-9885", "Description": "CONFIRM:https://pivotal.io/security/cve-2016-9885"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2017-01-06"}
