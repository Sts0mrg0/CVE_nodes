An exploitable code execution vulnerability exists in the jpeg2000 image file format parser as implemented in the OpenJpeg library. A specially crafted jpeg2000 file can cause an out of bound heap write resulting in heap corruption leading to arbitrary code execution. For a successful attack, the target user needs to open a malicious jpeg2000 file. The jpeg2000 image file format is mostly used for embedding images inside PDF documents and the OpenJpeg library is used by a number of popular PDF renderers making PDF documents a likely attack vector.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:01:49 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2017-11-03", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/93242", "Description": "BID:93242"}, {"URL": "http://www.debian.org/security/2017/dsa-3768", "Description": "DEBIAN:DSA-3768"}, {"URL": "http://www.talosintelligence.com/reports/TALOS-2016-0193/", "Description": "MISC:http://www.talosintelligence.com/reports/TALOS-2016-0193/"}, {"URL": "https://github.com/uclouvain/openjpeg/releases/tag/v2.1.2", "Description": "MISC:https://github.com/uclouvain/openjpeg/releases/tag/v2.1.2"}, {"URL": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1038623", "Description": "SECTRACK:1038623"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2016-10-28"}
