The login page of Revive Adserver is vulnerable to password-guessing attacks.

A random delay has instead been introduced as a countermeasure in case of password failures, along with a system to discourage parallel brute forcing. These systems will effectively allow the valid users to log in to the adserver, even while an attack is in progress.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:01:51 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2017-03-27", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "https://github.com/revive-adserver/revive-adserver/commit/847941390f5b3310d51b07c92ec91cc1f4cc82c9", "Description": "MISC:https://github.com/revive-adserver/revive-adserver/commit/847941390f5b3310d51b07c92ec91cc1f4cc82c9"}, {"URL": "https://hackerone.com/reports/96115", "Description": "MISC:https://hackerone.com/reports/96115"}, {"URL": "https://www.revive-adserver.com/security/revive-sa-2016-001/", "Description": "MISC:https://www.revive-adserver.com/security/revive-sa-2016-001/"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2017-03-27"}
