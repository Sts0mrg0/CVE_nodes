An unauthorized user with physical access to an Alaris 8015 PC unit may be able to obtain unencrypted wireless network authentication credentials and other sensitive technical data by disassembling an Alaris 8015 PC unit and accessing the device's flash memory. Older software versions of the Alaris 8015 PC unit, Version 9.5 and prior versions, store wireless network authentication credentials and other sensitive technical data on the affected device's removable flash memory. Being able to remove the flash memory from the affected device reduces the risk of detection, allowing an attacker to extract stored data at the attacker's convenience.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:01:52 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2017-02-14", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/96116", "Description": "BID:96116"}, {"URL": "https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/advisories/ICSMA-17-017-02", "Description": "MISC:https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/advisories/ICSMA-17-017-02"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2017-02-13"}
