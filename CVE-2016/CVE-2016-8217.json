A possible timing attack could be carried out by modifying a PKCS#12 file that has an integrity MAC for which the password is not known. An attacker could then feed the modified PKCS#12 file to the toolkit and guess the current MAC one byte at a time. This is possible because Crypto-J uses a non-constant-time method to compare the stored MAC with the calculated MAC. This vulnerability is similar to the issue described in CVE-2015-2601.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:01:49 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2017-07-24", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/95831", "Description": "BID:95831"}, {"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/540066/30/0/threaded", "Description": "CONFIRM:http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/540066/30/0/threaded"}, {"URL": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1037732", "Description": "SECTRACK:1037732"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2017-02-03"}
