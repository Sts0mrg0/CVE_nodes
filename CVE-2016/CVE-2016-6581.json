This attack occurs when an attacker inserts a header field that is exactly the size of the HPACK dynamic header table into the dynamic header table. The attacker can then send a header block that is simply repeated requests to expand that field in the dynamic table. This can lead to a gigantic compression ratio of 4,096 or better, meaning that 16kB of data can decompress to 64MB of data on the target machine.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:01:45 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2017-01-11", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/92315", "Description": "BID:92315"}, {"URL": "https://python-hyper.org/hpack/en/latest/security/CVE-2016-6581.html", "Description": "CONFIRM:https://python-hyper.org/hpack/en/latest/security/CVE-2016-6581.html"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2017-01-10"}
