An unauthorized user with physical access to an affected Alaris PC unit may be able to obtain unencrypted wireless network authentication credentials and other sensitive technical data by disassembling the PC unit and accessing the device's flash memory. The Alaris 8015 PC unit, Version 9.7, and the 8000 PC unit store wireless network authentication credentials and other sensitive technical data on internal flash memory. Accessing the internal flash memory of the affected device would require special tools to extract data and carrying out this attack at a healthcare facility would increase the likelihood of detection.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:01:49 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2017-02-14", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/96113", "Description": "BID:96113"}, {"URL": "https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/advisories/ICSMA-17-017-01", "Description": "MISC:https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/advisories/ICSMA-17-017-01"}, {"URL": "https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/advisories/ICSMA-17-017-02", "Description": "MISC:https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/advisories/ICSMA-17-017-02"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2017-02-13"}
