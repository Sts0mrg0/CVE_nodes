The vulnerability occurs when processing data for a formula used to render a chart via the HncChartPlugin.hplg library. Due to a lack of bounds-checking when incrementing an index that is used for writing into a buffer for formulae, the application can be made to write pointer data outside its bounds which can lead to code execution under the context of the application.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:01:40 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2017-01-09", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/92327", "Description": "BID:92327"}, {"URL": "http://www.talosintelligence.com/reports/TALOS-2016-0150/", "Description": "MISC:http://www.talosintelligence.com/reports/TALOS-2016-0150/"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2017-01-06"}
