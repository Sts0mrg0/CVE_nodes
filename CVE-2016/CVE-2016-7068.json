This issue is based on the fact that the PowerDNS server parses all records present in a query regardless of whether they are needed or even legitimate. A specially crafted query containing a large number of records can be used to take advantage of that behaviour.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:01:46 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2018-09-12", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2016-7068", "Description": "CONFIRM:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2016-7068"}, {"URL": "https://doc.powerdns.com/md/security/powerdns-advisory-2016-02/", "Description": "CONFIRM:https://doc.powerdns.com/md/security/powerdns-advisory-2016-02/"}, {"URL": "https://www.debian.org/security/2017/dsa-3763", "Description": "DEBIAN:DSA-3763"}, {"URL": "https://www.debian.org/security/2017/dsa-3764", "Description": "DEBIAN:DSA-3764"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2018-09-11"}
