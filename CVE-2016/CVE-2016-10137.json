The content provider named com.adups.fota.sysoper.provider.InfoProvider in the app with a package name of com.adups.fota.sysoper allows any app on the device to read, write, and delete files as the system user. In the com.adups.fota.sysoper app's AndroidManifest.xml file, it sets the android:sharedUserId attribute to a value of android.uid.system which makes it execute as the system user, which is a very privileged user on the device. This allows a third-party app to read, write, and delete the user's sent and received text messages and call log. This allows a third-party app to obtain PII from the user without permission to do so.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:01:30 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2017-03-15", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/96852", "Description": "BID:96852"}, {"URL": "https://www.kryptowire.com/adups_security_analysis.html", "Description": "MISC:https://www.kryptowire.com/adups_security_analysis.html"}, {"URL": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/16/us/politics/china-phones-software-security.html", "Description": "MISC:https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/16/us/politics/china-phones-software-security.html"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2017-01-13"}
