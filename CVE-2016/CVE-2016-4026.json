The content sanitizer component has an issue with filtering malicious content in case invalid HTML code is provided. In such cases the filter will output a unsanitized representation of the content. Malicious script code can be executed within a user's context. This can lead to session hijacking or triggering unwanted actions via the web interface (sending mail, deleting data etc.).
