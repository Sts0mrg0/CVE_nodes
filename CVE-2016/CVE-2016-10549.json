Version 0.12.7 and lower have an issue with the CORS configuration where the value of the origin header is reflected as the value for the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header. This would allow an attacker to make AJAX requests to vulnerable hosts through cross site scripting or a malicious HTML Document, effectively bypassing the Same Origin Policy. Note that this is only an issue when `allRoutes` is set to `true` and `origin` is set to `*` or left commented out in the sails CORS config file. The problem can be compounded when the cors `credentials` setting is not provided. At that point authenticated cross domain requests are possible.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:01:31 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2018-05-31", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://sailsjs.org/documentation/concepts/security/cors", "Description": "MISC:http://sailsjs.org/documentation/concepts/security/cors"}, {"URL": "http://sailsjs.org/documentation/reference/configuration/sails-config-cors", "Description": "MISC:http://sailsjs.org/documentation/reference/configuration/sails-config-cors"}, {"URL": "https://nodesecurity.io/advisories/148", "Description": "MISC:https://nodesecurity.io/advisories/148"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2018-05-31"}
