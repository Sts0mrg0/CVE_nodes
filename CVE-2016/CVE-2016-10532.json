A malicious user could bypass the authentication and execute any command that the user who is running the console-io application 2.2.13 and earlier is able to run. This means that if console-io was running from root, the attacker would have full access to the system. This vulnerability exists because the console-io application does not configure socket.io to require authentication, which allows a malicious user to connect via a websocket to send commands and receive the response.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:01:31 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2018-05-31", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "https://nodesecurity.io/advisories/90", "Description": "MISC:https://nodesecurity.io/advisories/90"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2018-05-31"}
