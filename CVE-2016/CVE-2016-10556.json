This causes potential SQL injection in sequelize 3.19.3 and earlier, where a malicious user could put `[\"test\", \"'); DELETE TestTable WHERE Id = 1 --')\"]` inside of ``` database.query('SELECT * FROM TestTable WHERE Name IN (:names)', { replacements: { names: directCopyOfUserInput } }); ``` and cause the SQL statement to become `SELECT Id FROM Table WHERE Name IN ('test', '\\'); DELETE TestTable WHERE Id = 1 --')`. In Postgres, MSSQL, and SQLite, the backslash has no special meaning.
