SEP 14.0 and later are not impacted by this issue. A non-admin user would need to be able to save an executable file to disk and then be able to successfully run that file. If properly constructed, the file could access the driver interface and potentially manipulate certain system calls. On all 32-bit systems and in most cases on 64-bit systems, this will result in a denial of service that will crash the system. In very narrow circumstances, and on 64-bit systems only, this could allow the user to run arbitrary code on the local machine with kernel-level privileges. This could result in a non-privileged user gaining privileged access on the local machine.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:01:51 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2018-04-17", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/96294", "Description": "BID:96294"}, {"URL": "https://www.symantec.com/security_response/securityupdates/detail.jsp?fid=security_advisory&pvid=security_advisory&year=&suid=20170306_00", "Description": "CONFIRM:https://www.symantec.com/security_response/securityupdates/detail.jsp?fid=security_advisory&pvid=security_advisory&year=&suid=20170306_00"}, {"URL": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1037961", "Description": "SECTRACK:1037961"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2018-04-16"}
