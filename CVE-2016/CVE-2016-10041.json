Under certain preconditions, it is possible to execute telegram simulation as a non-admin user. As prerequisites, a user must have created an online-connection, validly authenticated and authorized as administrator, and executed telegram simulation. After that, the online-connection must have been closed. Incorrect caching of client data then may lead to privilege escalation, where a subsequently acting non-admin user is permitted to do telegram simulation. In order to exploit this vulnerability, a potential attacker would need to have both a valid engineering-account in the SPRECON RBAC system as well as access to a service/maintenance computer with SPRECON-E Service Program running. Additionally, a valid admin-user must have closed the service connection beforehand without closing the program, having executed telegram simulation; the attacker then has access to the running software instance. Hence, there is no risk from external attackers.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:01:30 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2017-01-06", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/95296", "Description": "BID:95296"}, {"URL": "https://www.sprecher-automation.com/en/it-security/", "Description": "CONFIRM:https://www.sprecher-automation.com/en/it-security/"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2016-12-25"}
