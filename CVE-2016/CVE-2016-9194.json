The vulnerability is due to incomplete input validation of the 802.11 WME packet header. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malformed 802.11 WME frames to a targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the WLC to reload unexpectedly. The fixed versions are 8.0.140.0, 8.2.130.0, and 8.3.111.0.
