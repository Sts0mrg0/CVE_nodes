NOTE: The vendor disputes the existence of this potential issue in Android, stating \"This CVE was raised in error: it referred to the authentication tag size in GCM, whose default according to ASN.1 encoding (12 bytes) can lead to vulnerabilities. After careful consideration, it was decided that the insecure default value of 12 bytes was a default only for the encoding and not default anywhere else in Android, and hence no vulnerability existed.\"", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:01:36 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2016-08-07", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://source.android.com/security/bulletin/2016-04-02.html", "Description": "MISC:http://source.android.com/security/bulletin/2016-04-02.html"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2016-04-17"}
