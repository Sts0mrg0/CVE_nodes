When it attempts to convert a malformed PDF to XML a stack variable will be left uninitialized which will later be used to fetch a length that is used in a copy operation. In most cases this will allow an aggressor to write outside the bounds of a stack buffer which is used to contain colors. This can lead to code execution under the context of the account running the tool.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:01:49 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2017-03-01", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/96472", "Description": "BID:96472"}, {"URL": "http://www.talosintelligence.com/reports/TALOS-2016-0210/", "Description": "MISC:http://www.talosintelligence.com/reports/TALOS-2016-0210/"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2017-02-27"}
