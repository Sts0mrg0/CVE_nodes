These vulnerabilities occur in MgrDiagnosticTools.php (/controllers/MgrDiagnosticTools.php), in the component responsible for performing diagnostic tests with the UNIX wget utility. The application doesn't properly escape the information passed in the 'url' variable before calling the executeCommand class function ($this->dtObj->executeCommand). This function calls exec() with unsanitized user input allowing for remote command injection. The page that contains the vulnerabilities, /controllers/MgrDiagnosticTools.php, is accessed by a built-in command answered by the administrative interface. The command that calls to that vulnerable page (passed in the 'section' parameter) is: 'configuration'. Exploitation of this vulnerability yields shell access to the remote machine under the 'spiderman' user account.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:01:52 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2017-02-22", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/95858", "Description": "BID:95858"}, {"URL": "https://community.sophos.com/products/web-appliance/b/blog/posts/release-of-swa-version-4-3-1", "Description": "CONFIRM:https://community.sophos.com/products/web-appliance/b/blog/posts/release-of-swa-version-4-3-1"}, {"URL": "http://pastebin.com/UB8Ye6ZU", "Description": "MISC:http://pastebin.com/UB8Ye6ZU"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2017-01-28"}
