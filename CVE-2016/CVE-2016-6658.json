For example, the user could include a GitHub username and password in the URL to access a private repo. Because the URL to access the buildpack is stored unencrypted, an operator with privileged access to the Cloud Controller database could view these credentials.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:01:45 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2018-03-29", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "https://pivotal.io/security/cve-2016-6658", "Description": "CONFIRM:https://pivotal.io/security/cve-2016-6658"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2018-03-29"}
