The chan_sip channel driver has a liberal definition for whitespace when attempting to strip the content between a SIP header name and a colon character. Rather than following RFC 3261 and stripping only spaces and horizontal tabs, Asterisk treats any non-printable ASCII character as if it were whitespace. This means that headers such as Contact\\x01: will be seen as a valid Contact header. This mostly does not pose a problem until Asterisk is placed in tandem with an authenticating SIP proxy. In such a case, a crafty combination of valid and invalid To headers can cause a proxy to allow an INVITE request into Asterisk without authentication since it believes the request is an in-dialog request. However, because of the bug described above, the request will look like an out-of-dialog request to Asterisk. Asterisk will then process the request as a new call. The result is that Asterisk can process calls from unvetted sources without any authentication. If you do not use a proxy for authentication, then this issue does not affect you. If your proxy is dialog-aware (meaning that the proxy keeps track of what dialogs are currently valid), then this issue does not affect you. If you use chan_pjsip instead of chan_sip, then this issue does not affect you.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:01:53 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2017-07-26", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/94789", "Description": "BID:94789"}, {"URL": "http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/security/AST-2016-009.html", "Description": "CONFIRM:http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/security/AST-2016-009.html"}, {"URL": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1037408", "Description": "SECTRACK:1037408"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2016-12-12"}
