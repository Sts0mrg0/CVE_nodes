It only checks that the address is not in non-secure memory. A given address range can overlap with both secure and non-secure regions - hence if such an address is passed in, it would not pass the non-secure range check, and would be considered valid by the function, even though that memory area could be modified by the non-secure side.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:03:01 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2018-04-19", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/103671", "Description": "BID:103671"}, {"URL": "https://source.android.com/security/bulletin/2018-04-01", "Description": "CONFIRM:https://source.android.com/security/bulletin/2018-04-01"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2018-04-18"}
