The ce_util_to_unsigned_bin function, instead of operating on the size of the unsigned character buffer that is passed, operates on the address - i.e. operates on \"c\" instead of \"*c\". Decrementing the address to check if it is less than zero means that the operation will always pass, since a pointer will never be less than zero, and may result in a buffer overflow.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:03:01 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2018-04-19", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/103671", "Description": "BID:103671"}, {"URL": "https://source.android.com/security/bulletin/2018-04-01", "Description": "CONFIRM:https://source.android.com/security/bulletin/2018-04-01"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2018-04-18"}
