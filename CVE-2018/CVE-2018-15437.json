This could allow executable files to be launched on the system without being analyzed for threats. The vulnerability is due to improper process resource handling. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by gaining local access to a system running Microsoft Windows and protected by Cisco Immunet or Cisco AMP for Endpoints and executing a malicious file. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to prevent the scanning services from functioning properly and ultimately prevent the system from being protected from further intrusion.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 14:43:30 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2018-11-15", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105867", "Description": "BID:105867"}, {"URL": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181107-imm-dos", "Description": "CISCO:20181107 Cisco Immunet and Cisco AMP for Endpoints System Scan Denial of Service Vulnerability"}, {"URL": "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/45829/", "Description": "EXPLOIT-DB:45829"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2018-11-08"}
