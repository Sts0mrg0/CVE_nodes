An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a customized SPF packet to an affected device. If successful, an exploit could allow the attacker to bypass the URL filters that are configured for the affected device, which could allow malicious URLs to pass through the device.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 14:43:10 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2018-10-07", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105300", "Description": "BID:105300"}, {"URL": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180905-esa-url-bypass", "Description": "CISCO:20180905 Cisco Email Security Appliance URL Filtering Bypass Vulnerability"}, {"URL": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1041687", "Description": "SECTRACK:1041687"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2018-10-05"}
