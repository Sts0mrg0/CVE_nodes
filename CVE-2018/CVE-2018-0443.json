The vulnerability is due to improper input validation on fields within CAPWAP Discovery Request packets by the affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious CAPWAP Discovery Request packets to the Cisco WLC Software. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the Cisco WLC Software to disconnect associated access points (APs). While the APs disconnect and reconnect, service will be unavailable for a brief period of time, resulting in a DoS condition.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 14:43:10 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2018-10-23", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105686", "Description": "BID:105686"}, {"URL": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181017-wlc-capwap-dos", "Description": "CISCO:20181017 Cisco Wireless LAN Controller Software Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points Protocol Denial of Service Vulnerability"}, {"URL": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1041922", "Description": "SECTRACK:1041922"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2018-10-17"}
