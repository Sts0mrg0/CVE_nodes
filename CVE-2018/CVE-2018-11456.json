An attacker with network access to the device could send specially crafted network packets to determine whether or not a network port on another remote system is accessible or not. This allows the attacker to do basic network scanning using the victims machine. Successful exploitation requires a network connection to the affected device. The attacker does not need privileges, no user interaction is required. The impact is limited to determining whether or not a port on a target system is accessible by the affected device.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 14:43:16 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2018-08-21", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105114", "Description": "BID:105114"}, {"URL": "https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-920962.pdf", "Description": "CONFIRM:https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-920962.pdf"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2018-08-07"}
