The intended (and documented) behavior is that if an operator has not specified a value for the \"allow-recursion\" setting, it SHOULD default to one of the following: none, if \"recursion no;\" is set in named.conf; a value inherited from the \"allow-query-cache\" or \"allow-query\" settings IF \"recursion yes;\" (the default for that setting) AND match lists are explicitly set for \"allow-query-cache\" or \"allow-query\" (see the BIND9 Administrative Reference Manual section 6.2 for more details); or the intended default of \"allow-recursion {localhost; localnets;};\" if \"recursion yes;\" is in effect and no values are explicitly set for \"allow-query-cache\" or \"allow-query\". However, because of the regression introduced by change #4777, it is possible when \"recursion yes;\" is in effect and no match list values are provided for \"allow-query-cache\" or \"allow-query\" for the setting of \"allow-recursion\" to inherit a setting of all hosts from the \"allow-query\" setting default, improperly permitting recursion to all clients. Affects BIND 9.9.12, 9.10.7, 9.11.3, 9.12.0->9.12.1-P2, the development release 9.13.0, and also releases 9.9.12-S1, 9.10.7-S1, 9.11.3-S1, and 9.11.3-S2 from BIND 9 Supported Preview Edition.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 14:44:08 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-08-30", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "https://kb.isc.org/docs/aa-01616", "Description": "CONFIRM:https://kb.isc.org/docs/aa-01616"}, {"URL": "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20190830-0002/", "Description": "CONFIRM:https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20190830-0002/"}, {"URL": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201903-13", "Description": "GENTOO:GLSA-201903-13"}, {"URL": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1041115", "Description": "SECTRACK:1041115"}, {"URL": "https://usn.ubuntu.com/3683-1/", "Description": "UBUNTU:USN-3683-1"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-01-16"}
