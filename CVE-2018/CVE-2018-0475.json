The vulnerability is due to improper input validation when handling Cluster Management Protocol (CMP) messages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious CMP message to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the switch to crash and reload or to hang, resulting in a DoS condition. If the switch hangs it will not reboot automatically, and it will need to be power cycled manually to recover.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 14:43:10 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2018-10-07", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105404", "Description": "BID:105404"}, {"URL": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180926-cmp", "Description": "CISCO:20180926 Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Cluster Management Protocol Denial of Service Vulnerability"}, {"URL": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1041737", "Description": "SECTRACK:1041737"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2018-10-05"}
