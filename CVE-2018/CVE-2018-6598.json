Any app co-located on the device can send an intent to factory reset the device programmatically because of com.android.server.MasterClearReceiver. This does not require any user interaction and does not require any permission to perform. A factory reset will remove all user data from the device. This will result in the loss of any data that the user has not backed up or synced externally. This capability to perform a factory reset is not directly available to third-party apps (those that the user installs themselves), although this capability is present in an unprotected component of the Android OS. This vulnerability is not present in Google's Android Open Source Project (AOSP) code. Therefore, it was introduced by Orbic or another entity in the supply chain.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 14:44:11 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2018-08-29", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "https://www.kryptowire.com/portal/android-firmware-defcon-2018/", "Description": "MISC:https://www.kryptowire.com/portal/android-firmware-defcon-2018/"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2018-08-29"}
