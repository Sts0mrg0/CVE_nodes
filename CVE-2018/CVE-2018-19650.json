An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the processing of IOCTL 0x80002000 by the IRPFile.sys Antiy-AVL ATool kernel driver. The bug is caused by failure to properly validate the length of the user-supplied data, which results in a kernel stack buffer overflow. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code in the context of the kernel, which could lead to privilege escalation and a failed exploit could lead to denial of service.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 14:43:46 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2018-12-05", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/150549/ATool-1.0.0.22-Stack-Buffer-Overflow.html", "Description": "MISC:http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/150549/ATool-1.0.0.22-Stack-Buffer-Overflow.html"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2018-12-05"}
