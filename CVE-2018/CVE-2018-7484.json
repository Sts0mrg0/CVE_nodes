The client installation grants the Everyone group Full Control permission to the installation directory. In addition, the PureVPNService.exe service, which runs under NT Authority\\SYSTEM privileges, tries to load several dynamic-link libraries using relative paths instead of the absolute path. When not using a fully qualified path, the application will first try to load the library from the directory from which the application is started. As the residing directory of PureVPNService.exe is writable to all users, this makes the application susceptible to privilege escalation through DLL hijacking.", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 14:44:15 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "editor": "warcup", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.defensecode.com/advisories/DC-2018-02-001-PureVPN-Windows-Privilege-Escalation.pdf", "Description": "MISC:http://www.defensecode.com/advisories/DC-2018-02-001-PureVPN-Windows-Privilege-Escalation.pdf"}, {"URL": "https://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/541803", "Description": "MISC:https://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/541803"}], "cve_repaire": "", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "add_time": "2018-02-25"}
