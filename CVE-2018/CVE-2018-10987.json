The affected vacuum cleaner suffers from an authenticated remote code execution vulnerability. An authenticated attacker can send a specially crafted UDP packet, and execute commands on the vacuum cleaner as root. The bug is in the function REQUEST_SET_WIFIPASSWD (UDP command 153). A crafted UDP packet runs \"/mnt/skyeye/mode_switch.sh %s\" with an attacker controlling the %s variable. In some cases, authentication can be achieved with the default password of 888888 for the admin account.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 14:43:15 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2018-07-05", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "https://gist.github.com/neolead/10b27c5c04bca84a5515783ca6f2ecb4#file-cve-2018-10987-txt", "Description": "MISC:https://gist.github.com/neolead/10b27c5c04bca84a5515783ca6f2ecb4#file-cve-2018-10987-txt"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2018-07-05"}
