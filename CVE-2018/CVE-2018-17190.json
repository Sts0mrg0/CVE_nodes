The master itself does not, by design, execute user code. A specially-crafted request to the master can, however, cause the master to execute code too. Note that this does not affect standalone clusters with authentication enabled. While the master host typically has less outbound access to other resources than a worker, the execution of code on the master is nevertheless unexpected.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 14:43:37 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-03-28", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105976", "Description": "BID:105976"}, {"URL": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201903-21", "Description": "GENTOO:GLSA-201903-21"}, {"URL": "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/341c3187f15cdb0d353261d2bfecf2324d56cb7db1339bfc7b30f6e5@%3Cdev.spark.apache.org%3E", "Description": "MISC:https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/341c3187f15cdb0d353261d2bfecf2324d56cb7db1339bfc7b30f6e5@%3Cdev.spark.apache.org%3E"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2018-11-19"}
