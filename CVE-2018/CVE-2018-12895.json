This is related to missing filename validation in the wp-includes/post.php wp_delete_attachment function. The attacker must have capabilities for files and posts that are normally available only to the Author, Editor, and Administrator roles. The attack methodology is to delete wp-config.php and then launch a new installation process to increase the attacker's privileges.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 14:43:21 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2018-07-30", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/104569", "Description": "BID:104569"}, {"URL": "https://www.debian.org/security/2018/dsa-4250", "Description": "DEBIAN:DSA-4250"}, {"URL": "https://blog.ripstech.com/2018/wordpress-file-delete-to-code-execution/", "Description": "MISC:https://blog.ripstech.com/2018/wordpress-file-delete-to-code-execution/"}, {"URL": "https://wpvulndb.com/vulnerabilities/9100", "Description": "MISC:https://wpvulndb.com/vulnerabilities/9100"}, {"URL": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2018/07/msg00046.html", "Description": "MLIST:[debian-lts-announce] 20180730 [SECURITY] [DLA 1452-1] wordpress security update"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2018-06-26"}
