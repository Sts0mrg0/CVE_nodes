To send the commands, the attacker must have root privileges for at least one affected sensor or the Cisco FMC. The vulnerability exists because the affected software performs insufficient checks for certain CLI commands, if the commands are executed via a Sourcefire tunnel connection. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating with root privileges to a Firepower sensor or Cisco FMC, and then sending specific CLI commands to the Cisco FMC or through the Cisco FMC to another Firepower sensor via the Sourcefire tunnel connection. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to modify device configurations or delete files on the device that is running Cisco FMC Software or on any Firepower device that is managed by Cisco FMC.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 14:43:10 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2018-10-05", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181003-fp-cmd-injection", "Description": "CISCO:20181003 Cisco Firepower Management Center and Firepower System Software Sourcefire Tunnel Control Channel Command Execution Vulnerability"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2018-10-05"}
