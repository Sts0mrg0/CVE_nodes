The vulnerability is due to improper memory handling by the affected software when the software processes high rates of Cisco Discovery Protocol packets that are sent to a device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a high rate of Cisco Discovery Protocol packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust memory on the affected device, resulting in a DoS condition.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 14:43:30 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-04-12", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105413", "Description": "BID:105413"}, {"URL": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180926-cdp-dos", "Description": "CISCO:20180926 Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Cisco Discovery Protocol Denial of Service Vulnerability"}, {"URL": "https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/advisories/ICSA-19-094-03", "Description": "MISC:https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/advisories/ICSA-19-094-03"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2018-10-05"}
