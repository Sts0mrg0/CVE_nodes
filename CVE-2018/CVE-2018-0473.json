A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition for the PTP subsystem, resulting in time synchronization issues across the network.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 14:43:10 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-04-12", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105427", "Description": "BID:105427"}, {"URL": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180926-ptp", "Description": "CISCO:20180926 Cisco IOS Software Precision Time Protocol Denial of Service Vulnerability"}, {"URL": "https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/advisories/ICSA-19-094-03", "Description": "MISC:https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/advisories/ICSA-19-094-03"}, {"URL": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1041737", "Description": "SECTRACK:1041737"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2018-10-05"}
