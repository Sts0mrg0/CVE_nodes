With a debug host processor A running in non-secure EL1 and a debug target processor B running in any privilege level, the debugging feature allows A to halt B and promote B to any privilege level. As a debug host, A has full control of B even if B owns a higher privilege level than A. Accordingly, A can read/write any EL3 memory/register via B. Also, with this memory access, A can execute arbitrary code in EL3.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 14:43:41 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-04-04", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.cs.wayne.edu/fengwei/paper/nailgun-sp19.pdf", "Description": "MISC:http://www.cs.wayne.edu/fengwei/paper/nailgun-sp19.pdf"}, {"URL": "https://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings-article/sp/2019/666000b157/17D45WHONhv", "Description": "MISC:https://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings-article/sp/2019/666000b157/17D45WHONhv"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-04-04"}
