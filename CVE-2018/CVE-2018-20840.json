It potentially causes an outage of third-party services that were not designed to recover from exceptions. On the client, ID token handling can cause an unhandled exception because of misinterpretation of an integer as a string, resulting in denial-of-service and then other users can no longer login/sign-in to the affected third-party service. Once this third-party service uses Google Sign-In with google-api-cpp-client, a malicious user can trigger this client/auth/oauth2_authorization.cc vulnerability by requesting the client to receive the ID token from a Google authentication server.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 14:43:52 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-05-30", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "https://github.com/google/google-api-cpp-client/issues/57", "Description": "MISC:https://github.com/google/google-api-cpp-client/issues/57"}, {"URL": "https://github.com/google/google-api-cpp-client/pull/58", "Description": "MISC:https://github.com/google/google-api-cpp-client/pull/58"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-05-30"}
