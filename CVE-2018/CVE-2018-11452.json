Specially crafted packets to port 102/tcp could cause a denial-of-service condition in the EN100 communication module if oscillographs are running. A manual restart is required to recover the EN100 module functionality. Successful exploitation requires an attacker with network access to send multiple packets to the EN100 module. As a precondition the IEC 61850-MMS communication needs to be activated on the affected EN100 modules. No user interaction or privileges are required to exploit the security vulnerability. The vulnerability could allow causing a Denial-of-Service condition of the network functionality of the device, compromising the availability of the system. At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 14:43:16 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-03-22", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "https://www.securityfocus.com/bid/106221", "Description": "BID:106221"}, {"URL": "https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-325546.pdf", "Description": "CONFIRM:https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-325546.pdf"}, {"URL": "https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-635129.pdf", "Description": "CONFIRM:https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-635129.pdf"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2018-07-23"}
