The vulnerability is due to the lack of args/input validation on render_html before allowing it to be called by extract(), a PHP built-in function. Because of this, the supplied args/input can be used to overwrite the $pagepath variable, which then could lead to a local file inclusion attack.", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 14:44:20 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "editor": "warcup", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "https://sec-consult.com/en/blog/advisories/arbitrary-shortcode-execution-local-file-inclusion-in-woof-pluginus-net/index.html", "Description": "MISC:https://sec-consult.com/en/blog/advisories/arbitrary-shortcode-execution-local-file-inclusion-in-woof-pluginus-net/index.html"}, {"URL": "https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-products-filter/#developers", "Description": "MISC:https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-products-filter/#developers"}, {"URL": "https://www.woocommerce-filter.com/update-woocommerce-products-filter-v-2-2-0/", "Description": "MISC:https://www.woocommerce-filter.com/update-woocommerce-products-filter-v-2-2-0/"}], "cve_repaire": "", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "add_time": "2018-03-14"}
