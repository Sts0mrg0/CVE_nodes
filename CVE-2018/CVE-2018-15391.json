The vulnerability is due to the affected software not validating and calculating certain numerical values in IPv4 packets that are sent to an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malformed IPv4 traffic to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to disrupt the flow of certain IPv4 traffic passing through an affected device, which could result in a DoS condition.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 14:43:30 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2018-10-05", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181003-phy-ipv4-dos", "Description": "CISCO:20181003 Cisco Remote PHY IPv4 Fragment Denial of Service Vulnerability"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2018-10-05"}
