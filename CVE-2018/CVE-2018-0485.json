The vulnerability is due to improper handling of user input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by first connecting to the SM-1T3/E3 module console and entering a string sequence. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the ISR G2 Router or the SM-1T3/E3 module on the ISR4451-X to reload, resulting in a DoS condition on an affected device.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 14:43:10 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2018-10-07", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105433", "Description": "BID:105433"}, {"URL": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180926-sm1t3e3", "Description": "CISCO:20180926 Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software SM-1T3/E3 Service Module Denial of Service Vulnerability"}, {"URL": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1041736", "Description": "SECTRACK:1041736"}, {"URL": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1041737", "Description": "SECTRACK:1041737"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2018-10-05"}
