The vulnerability is due to the system not strictly filtering the file upload type. An attacker can exploit the vulnerability to upload a script Trojan to admin.php/admin/configset/index/group/upload.html to gain server control by composing a request for a .txt upload and then changing it to a .php upload. The attacker must have admin access to change the upload_file_ext (aka \"Allow upload file suffix\") setting, and must use \"php,php\" in this setting to bypass the \"php\" restriction.", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 14:43:29 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "editor": "warcup", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "https://github.com/yxcmf/ukcms/issues/1", "Description": "MISC:https://github.com/yxcmf/ukcms/issues/1"}], "cve_repaire": "", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "add_time": "2018-08-03"}
