The products can be configured with a SAML authentication realm to authenticate network users in intercepted proxy traffic. When parsing SAML responses, ASG and ProxySG incorrectly handle XML nodes with comments. A remote attacker can modify a valid SAML response without invalidating its cryptographic signature. This may allow the attacker to bypass user authentication security controls in ASG and ProxySG. This vulnerability only affects authentication of network users in intercepted traffic. It does not affect administrator user authentication for the ASG and ProxySG management consoles.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 14:44:06 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2018-05-30", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/104282", "Description": "BID:104282"}, {"URL": "https://www.symantec.com/security-center/network-protection-security-advisories/SA167", "Description": "CONFIRM:https://www.symantec.com/security-center/network-protection-security-advisories/SA167"}, {"URL": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1040993", "Description": "SECTRACK:1040993"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2018-05-29"}
