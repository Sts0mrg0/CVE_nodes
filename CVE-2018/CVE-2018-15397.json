The vulnerability is due to an error that may occur if the affected software renegotiates the encryption key for an IPsec tunnel when certain TFC traffic is in flight. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious stream of TFC traffic through an established IPsec tunnel on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a daemon process on the affected device to crash, which could cause the device to crash and result in a DoS condition.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 14:43:30 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2018-10-07", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181003-asa-ipsec-dos", "Description": "CISCO:20181003 Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance IPsec VPN Denial of Service Vulnerability"}, {"URL": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1041786", "Description": "SECTRACK:1041786"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2018-10-05"}
