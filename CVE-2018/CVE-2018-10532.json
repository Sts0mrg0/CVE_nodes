Hardcoded root SSH credentials were discovered to be stored within the \"core_app\" binary utilised by the EE router for networking services. An attacker with knowledge of the default password (oelinux123) could login to the router via SSH as the root user, which could allow for the loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system. This would also allow for the bypass of the \"AP Isolation\" mode that is supported by the router, as well as the settings for multiple Wireless networks, which a user may use for guest clients.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 14:43:13 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2018-10-30", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "https://blog.jameshemmings.co.uk/2018/10/24/4gee-hh70-router-vulnerability-disclosure/", "Description": "MISC:https://blog.jameshemmings.co.uk/2018/10/24/4gee-hh70-router-vulnerability-disclosure/"}, {"URL": "https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/10/26/ee_4gee_hh70_ssh_backdoor/", "Description": "MISC:https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/10/26/ee_4gee_hh70_ssh_backdoor/"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2018-10-30"}
