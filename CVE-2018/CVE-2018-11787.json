One part of the console is a Gogo shell/console that gives access to the command line console of Karaf via a Web browser, and when navigated to it is available at .../system/console/gogo. Trying to go directly to that URL does require authentication. And optional bundle that some applications use is the Pax Web Extender Whiteboard, it is part of the pax-war feature and perhaps others. When it is installed, the Gogo console becomes available at another URL .../gogo/, and that URL is not secured giving access to the Karaf console to unauthenticated users. A mitigation for the issue is to manually stop/uninstall Gogo plugin bundle that is installed with the webconsole feature, although of course this removes the console from the .../system/console application, not only from the unauthenticated endpoint. One could also stop/uninstall the Pax Web Extender Whiteboard, but other components/applications may require it and so their functionality would be reduced/compromised.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 14:43:18 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2018-09-18", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://karaf.apache.org/security/cve-2018-11787.txt", "Description": "CONFIRM:http://karaf.apache.org/security/cve-2018-11787.txt"}, {"URL": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KARAF-4993", "Description": "CONFIRM:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KARAF-4993"}, {"URL": "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/d9ba4c3104ba32225646879a057b75b54430f349c246c85469037d3c@%3Cdev.karaf.apache.org%3E", "Description": "MLIST:[karaf-dev] 20180918 [SECURITY] New security advisory for CVE-2018-11787 released for Apache Karaf"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2018-09-18"}
