The vulnerability is due to a deadlock condition that may occur when an affected AP attempts to dequeue aggregated traffic that is destined to an attacker-controlled wireless client. An attacker who can successfully transition between multiple Service Set Identifiers (SSIDs) hosted on the same AP while replicating the required traffic patterns could trigger the deadlock condition. A watchdog timer that detects the condition will trigger a reload of the device, resulting in a DoS condition while the device restarts.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 14:43:10 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2018-10-23", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105685", "Description": "BID:105685"}, {"URL": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181017-aironet-dos", "Description": "CISCO:20181017 Cisco Aironet 1560, 1800, 2800, and 3800 Series Access Points Denial of Service Vulnerability"}, {"URL": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1041929", "Description": "SECTRACK:1041929"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2018-10-17"}
