The vulnerability is due to the improper processing of certain EAPOL frames. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a stream of crafted EAPOL frames to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to force the access point (AP) to disassociate all the associated stations (STAs) and to disallow future, new association requests.
