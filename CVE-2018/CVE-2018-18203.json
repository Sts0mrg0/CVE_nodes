This occurs because the device accepts modified QNX6 filesystem images (as long as the attacker obtains access to certain Harman decryption/encryption code) as a consequence of a bug where unsigned images pass a validity check. An attacker could potentially install persistent malicious head unit firmware and execute arbitrary code as the root user.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 14:43:41 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2018-11-28", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "https://github.com/sgayou/subaru_starlink_research", "Description": "MISC:https://github.com/sgayou/subaru_starlink_research"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2018-11-28"}
