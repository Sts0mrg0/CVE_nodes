The vulnerability is due to errors that could occur when the affected software constructs and applies per-user-override rules. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to a network through an affected device that has a vulnerable configuration. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access resources that are behind the affected device and would typically be protected by the interface ACL.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 14:43:30 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2018-10-07", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105517", "Description": "BID:105517"}, {"URL": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181003-asa-acl-bypass", "Description": "CISCO:20181003 Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance Access Control List Bypass Vulnerability"}, {"URL": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1041788", "Description": "SECTRACK:1041788"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2018-10-05"}
