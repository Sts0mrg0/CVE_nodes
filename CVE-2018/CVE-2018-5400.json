The originating device sends a message in plaintext, 48:65:6c:6c:6f:20:57:6f:72:6c:64, \"Hello World\" over UDP ports 44444-44446 to the broadcast address for the LAN. Without verification devices respond to any of these broadcast messages on the LAN with a plaintext reply over UDP containing the device model and firmware version. Following this exchange the devices allow Modbus transmissions between the two devices on the standard Modbus port 502 TCP. Impact: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to send arbitrary messages to any DCU or RP device through spoofing or replay attacks as long as they have access to the network. Affected releases are Auto-Maskin DCU-210E RP-210E: Versions prior to 3.7 on ARMv7.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 14:44:07 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2018-10-08", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/176301", "Description": "CERT-VN:VU#176301"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2018-10-08"}
