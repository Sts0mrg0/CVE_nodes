The vulnerability is due to node-jose following the JSON Web Signature (JWS) standard for JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). This standard specifies that a JSON Web Key (JWK) representing a public key can be embedded within the header of a JWS. This public key is then trusted for verification. An attacker could exploit this by forging valid JWS objects by removing the original signature, adding a new public key to the header, and then signing the object using the (attacker-owned) private key associated with the public key embedded in that JWS header.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 14:43:09 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2018-03-28", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/102445", "Description": "BID:102445"}, {"URL": "https://github.com/cisco/node-jose/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md", "Description": "CONFIRM:https://github.com/cisco/node-jose/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md"}, {"URL": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/viewAlert.x?alertId=56326", "Description": "CONFIRM:https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/viewAlert.x?alertId=56326"}, {"URL": "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/44324/", "Description": "EXPLOIT-DB:44324"}, {"URL": "https://github.com/zi0Black/POC-CVE-2018-0114", "Description": "MISC:https://github.com/zi0Black/POC-CVE-2018-0114"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2018-01-04"}
