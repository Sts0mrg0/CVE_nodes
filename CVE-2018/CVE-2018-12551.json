This typically means that the malformed data becomes a username and no password. If this occurs, clients can circumvent authentication and get access to the broker by using the malformed username. In particular, a blank line will be treated as a valid empty username. Other security measures are unaffected. Users who have only used the mosquitto_passwd utility to create and modify their password files are unaffected by this vulnerability.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 14:43:20 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-03-27", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=543401", "Description": "CONFIRM:https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=543401"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-03-27"}
