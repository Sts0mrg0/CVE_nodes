By continuously sending the same specific Draft-Rosen MVPN control packet, an attacker can repeatedly crash the RPD process causing a prolonged denial of service. This issue may occur when the Junos OS device is configured for Draft-Rosen multicast virtual private network (MVPN). The VPN is multicast-enabled and configured to use Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) protocol within the VPN. This issue can only be exploited from the PE device within the MPLS domain which is capable of forwarding IP multicast traffic in core. End-users connected to the CE device cannot cause this crash.
