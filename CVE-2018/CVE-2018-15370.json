The vulnerability is due to the presence of a hidden command in the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to an affected device via the console, forcing the device into ROMMON mode, and writing a malicious pattern to a specific memory address on the device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass signature validation checks by Cisco Secure Boot technology and load a compromised software image on the affected device. A compromised software image is any software image that has not been digitally signed by Cisco.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 14:43:30 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2018-10-07", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105412", "Description": "BID:105412"}, {"URL": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180926-catalyst6800", "Description": "CISCO:20180926 Cisco Catalyst 6800 Series Switches ROM Monitor Software Secure Boot Bypass Vulnerability"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2018-10-05"}
