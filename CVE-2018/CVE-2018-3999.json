A specially crafted image embedded within a document can cause a length to be miscalculated and underflow. This length is then treated as unsigned and then used in a copying operation. Due to the length underflow, the application will then write outside the bounds of a stack buffer, resulting in a buffer overflow. An attacker must convince a victim to open a document in order to trigger this vulnerability.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 14:44:00 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2018-10-01", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2018-0667", "Description": "MISC:https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2018-0667"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2018-10-01"}
