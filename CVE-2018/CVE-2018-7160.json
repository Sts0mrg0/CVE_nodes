An attack is possible from malicious websites open in a web browser on the same computer, or another computer with network access to the computer running the Node.js process. A malicious website could use a DNS rebinding attack to trick the web browser to bypass same-origin-policy checks and to allow HTTP connections to localhost or to hosts on the local network. If a Node.js process with the debug port active is running on localhost or on a host on the local network, the malicious website could connect to it as a debugger, and get full code execution access.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 14:44:14 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2018-05-17", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/march-2018-security-releases/", "Description": "CONFIRM:https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/march-2018-security-releases/"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2018-05-17"}
