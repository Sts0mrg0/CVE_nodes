On startup, the process Heimdal.MonitorServices.exe running as SYSTEM will attempt to load version.dll from this directory. Placing a malicious version.dll in this directory will result in privilege escalation. NOTE: any affected Heimdal products are completely unrelated to the Heimdal vendor of a Kerberos 5 product on the h5l.org web site.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 14:44:07 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2018-03-22", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "https://improsec.com/blog/heimdal-advisory-1", "Description": "MISC:https://improsec.com/blog/heimdal-advisory-1"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2018-03-22"}
