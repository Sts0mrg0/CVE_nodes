The vulnerability occurs because the configuration of the Shell Access Filter, when used with a specific type of remote authentication, can cause a system file to have unbounded writes. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a steady stream of remote authentication requests to the appliance when the specific configuration is applied. Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to increase the size of a system log file so that it consumes most of the disk space. The lack of available disk space could lead to a DoS condition in which the device functions could operate abnormally, making the device unstable.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 14:43:31 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-01-11", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/106516", "Description": "BID:106516"}, {"URL": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190109-fpwr-mc-dos", "Description": "CISCO:20190109 Cisco Firepower Management Center Disk Utilization Denial of Service Vulnerability"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-01-10"}
