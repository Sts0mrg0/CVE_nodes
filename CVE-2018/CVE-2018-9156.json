The upload web page doesn't verify the file type, and an attacker can upload a webshell by making a fileUpload.shtml request for a custom .shtml file, which is interpreted by the Apache HTTP Server mod_include module with \"<!--#exec cmd=\" support. The file needs to include a specific string to meet the internal system architecture. After the webshell upload, an attacker can use the webshell to perform remote code execution such as running a system command (ls, ping, cat /etc/passwd, etc.). NOTE: the vendor reportedly indicates that this is an intended feature or functionality.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 14:44:22 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2018-04-01", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "https://www.slideshare.net/secret/aewA1dZwZ9FQ8g", "Description": "MISC:https://www.slideshare.net/secret/aewA1dZwZ9FQ8g"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2018-04-01"}
