The vulnerability comes from a portion of code where pages are redirected and loaded within phpMyAdmin, and an improper test for whitelisted pages. An attacker must be authenticated, except in the \"$cfg['AllowArbitraryServer'] = true\" case (where an attacker can specify any host he/she is already in control of, and execute arbitrary code on phpMyAdmin) and the \"$cfg['ServerDefault'] = 0\" case (which bypasses the login requirement and runs the vulnerable code without any authentication).", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 14:43:20 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-04-15", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/104532", "Description": "BID:104532"}, {"URL": "https://www.phpmyadmin.net/security/PMASA-2018-4/", "Description": "CONFIRM:https://www.phpmyadmin.net/security/PMASA-2018-4/"}, {"URL": "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/44924/", "Description": "EXPLOIT-DB:44924"}, {"URL": "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/44928/", "Description": "EXPLOIT-DB:44928"}, {"URL": "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/45020/", "Description": "EXPLOIT-DB:45020"}, {"URL": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201904-16", "Description": "GENTOO:GLSA-201904-16"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2018-06-21"}
