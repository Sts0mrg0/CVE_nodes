It is possible for an attacker to access the administration panel on TCP port 9990 without any authentication using \"anonymous\" access that is automatically created. Once logged in, a misconfiguration present by default (auto-deployment) permits an anonymous user to deploy a malicious .war file, leading to remote code execution. NOTE: the vendor indicates that anonymous access is not available in the default installation; however, it remains optional because there are several use cases for it, including development environments and network architectures that have a proxy server for access control to the WildFly server.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 14:43:14 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2018-05-14", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "https://github.com/kmkz/exploit/blob/master/CVE-2018-10682-CVE-2018-10683.txt", "Description": "MISC:https://github.com/kmkz/exploit/blob/master/CVE-2018-10682-CVE-2018-10683.txt"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2018-05-09"}
