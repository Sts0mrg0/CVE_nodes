The affected CPUs improperly validate S7 communication packets which could cause a Denial-of-Service condition of the CPU. The CPU will remain in DEFECT mode until manual restart. Successful exploitation requires an attacker to be able to send a specially crafted S7 communication packet to a communication interface of the CPU. This includes Ethernet, PROFIBUS, and Multi Point Interfaces (MPI). No user interaction or privileges are required to exploit the security vulnerability. The vulnerability could allow causing a Denial-of-Service condition of the core functionality of the CPU, compromising the availability of the system. At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known. Siemens confirms the security vulnerability and provides mitigations to resolve the security issue.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 14:43:35 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-04-17", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-306710.pdf", "Description": "MISC:https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-306710.pdf"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-04-17"}
