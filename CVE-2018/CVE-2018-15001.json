When logging is enabled, there is a notification in the status bar, so it is not completely transparent to the user. The user can cancel the logging, but it can be re-enabled since the app with a package name of com.vivo.bsptest cannot be disabled. The writing of these logs can be initiated by an app co-located on the device, although the READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission is necessary to for an app to access the log files.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 14:43:29 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2018-12-28", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "https://www.kryptowire.com/portal/android-firmware-defcon-2018/", "Description": "MISC:https://www.kryptowire.com/portal/android-firmware-defcon-2018/"}, {"URL": "https://www.kryptowire.com/portal/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/DEFCON-26-Johnson-and-Stavrou-Vulnerable-Out-of-the-Box-An-Eval-of-Android-Carrier-Devices-WP-Updated.pdf", "Description": "MISC:https://www.kryptowire.com/portal/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/DEFCON-26-Johnson-and-Stavrou-Vulnerable-Out-of-the-Box-An-Eval-of-Android-Carrier-Devices-WP-Updated.pdf"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2018-12-28"}
