The cookie data is then used in an SQL statement. This allows for an SQL injection attack. Access to this portion of a VCL system requires admin level rights. Other layers of security seem to protect against malicious attack. However, all VCL systems running versions earlier than 2.5.1 should be upgraded or patched.
