These IVR systems rely on various frequencies of audio signals; based on the frequency, certain commands and functions are processed. Since these frequencies are accepted within a phone call, an attacker can record these frequencies and use them for service activations. This is a request-forgery issue when the required series of DTMF signals for a service activation is predictable (e.g., the IVR system does not speak a nonce to the caller). In this case, the IVR system accepts an activation request from a less-secure channel (any loudspeaker in the caller's physical environment) without verifying that the request was intended (it matches a nonce sent over a more-secure channel to the caller's earpiece).", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 14:43:17 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2018-05-30", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://virgil-cj.blogspot.com/2018/05/0day-legacy-ivr-lets-phreak.html", "Description": "MISC:http://virgil-cj.blogspot.com/2018/05/0day-legacy-ivr-lets-phreak.html"}, {"URL": "https://datarift.blogspot.com/2018/05/CVE-2018-11518-abusing-ivr-systems.html", "Description": "MISC:https://datarift.blogspot.com/2018/05/CVE-2018-11518-abusing-ivr-systems.html"}, {"URL": "https://twitter.com/mishradhiraj_/status/1001664204485652482", "Description": "MISC:https://twitter.com/mishradhiraj_/status/1001664204485652482"}, {"URL": "https://twitter.com/mishradhiraj_/status/1001664440759091207", "Description": "MISC:https://twitter.com/mishradhiraj_/status/1001664440759091207"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2018-05-30"}
