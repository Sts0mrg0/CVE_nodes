ASLR is an exploit mitigation technique used by modern Windows platforms. For ASLR to function, Windows executables must contain a relocations table. Despite containing the \"Dynamic base\" PE header, which indicates ASLR compatibility, Windows executables produced by mingw-w64 have the relocations table stripped from them by default. This means that executables produced by mingw-w64 are vulnerable to return-oriented programming (ROP) attacks. Windows executables generated by mingw-w64 claim to be ASLR compatible, but are not. Vulnerabilities in such executables are more easily exploitable as a result.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 14:44:07 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2018-08-14", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/307144", "Description": "CERT-VN:VU#307144"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2018-08-14"}
