A specially crafted document can cause an uninitialized pointer representing a TTableRow to be assigned to a variable on the stack. This variable is later dereferenced and then written to allow for controlled heap corruption, which can lead to code execution under the context of the application. An attacker must convince a victim to open a document in order to trigger this vulnerability.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 14:44:01 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2018-10-01", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2018-0669", "Description": "MISC:https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2018-0669"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2018-10-01"}
