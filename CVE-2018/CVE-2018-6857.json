By crafting an input buffer we can control the execution path to the point where the constant 0x12 will be written to a user-controlled address. We can take advantage of this condition to modify the SEP_TOKEN_PRIVILEGES structure of the Token object belonging to the exploit process and grant SE_DEBUG_NAME privilege. This allows the exploit process to interact with higher privileged processes running as SYSTEM and execute code in their security context.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 14:44:13 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2018-07-09", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "https://community.sophos.com/kb/en-us/131934", "Description": "CONFIRM:https://community.sophos.com/kb/en-us/131934"}, {"URL": "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2018/Jul/20", "Description": "FULLDISC:20180706 Sophos Safeguard Products - Multiple Privilege Escalation Vulnerabilities."}, {"URL": "https://labs.nettitude.com/blog/cve-2018-6851-to-cve-2018-6857-sophos-privilege-escalation-vulnerabilities/", "Description": "MISC:https://labs.nettitude.com/blog/cve-2018-6851-to-cve-2018-6857-sophos-privilege-escalation-vulnerabilities/"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2018-07-09"}
