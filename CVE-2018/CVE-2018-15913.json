One type of page in Cloudera Manager uses a 'returnUrl' parameter to redirect the user to another page in Cloudera Manager once a wizard is completed. The validity of this parameter was not checked. As a result, the user could be automatically redirected to an attacker's external site or perform a malicious JavaScript function that results in cross-site scripting (XSS). This was fixed by not allowing any value in the returnUrl parameter with patterns such as http://, https://, //, or javascript. The only exceptions to this rule are the SAML Login/Logout URLs, which remain supported since they are explicitly configured and they are not passed via the returnUrl parameter.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 14:43:32 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-06-20", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "https://www.cloudera.com/documentation/other/security-bulletins/topics/Security-Bulletin.html", "Description": "CONFIRM:https://www.cloudera.com/documentation/other/security-bulletins/topics/Security-Bulletin.html"}, {"URL": "https://www.cloudera.com/documentation/other/security-bulletins/topics/Security-Bulletin.html#cloudera_manager", "Description": "MISC:https://www.cloudera.com/documentation/other/security-bulletins/topics/Security-Bulletin.html#cloudera_manager"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-06-20"}
