The vulnerability exists because the affected software does not properly clear previously assigned session identifiers for a user session when a user authenticates to the web-based interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using an existing session identifier to connect to the software through the web-based interface. Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to hijack an authenticated user's browser session on the system. Versions 8.1 and 8.5 are affected.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 14:43:10 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-04-19", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108005", "Description": "BID:108005"}, {"URL": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190417-wlan-hijack", "Description": "CISCO:20190417 Cisco Wireless LAN Controller Software Session Hijacking Vulnerability"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-04-17"}
