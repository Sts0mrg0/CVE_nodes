A specially crafted document can cause Atlantis to skip initializing a value representing the number of columns of a table. Later, the application will use this as a length within a loop that will write to a pointer on the heap. Due to this value being controlled, a buffer overflow will occur, which can lead to code execution under the context of the application. An attacker must convince a victim to open a document in order to trigger this vulnerability.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 14:44:00 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2018-10-01", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2018-0652", "Description": "MISC:https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2018-0652"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2018-10-01"}
