The vulnerability is due to improper validation of SNMP protocol data units (PDUs) in SNMP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted SNMP packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the SNMP application to restart multiple times, leading to a system-level restart and a denial of service (DoS) condition.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 14:43:10 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2018-10-19", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105668", "Description": "BID:105668"}, {"URL": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181017-nxos-snmp", "Description": "CISCO:20181017 Cisco NX-OS Software Authenticated Simple Network Management Protocol Denial of Service Vulnerability"}, {"URL": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1041921", "Description": "SECTRACK:1041921"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2018-10-17"}
