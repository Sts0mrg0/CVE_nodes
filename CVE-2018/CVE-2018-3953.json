Data entered into the 'Router Name' input field through the web portal is submitted to apply.cgi as the value to the 'machine_name' POST parameter. When the 'preinit' binary receives the SIGHUP signal, it enters a code path that continues until it reaches offset 0x0042B5C4 in the 'start_lltd' function. Within the 'start_lltd' function, a 'nvram_get' call is used to obtain the value of the user-controlled 'machine_name' NVRAM entry. This value is then entered directly into a command intended to write the host name to a file and subsequently executed.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 14:44:00 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2018-10-16", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2018-0625", "Description": "MISC:https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2018-0625"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2018-10-16"}
