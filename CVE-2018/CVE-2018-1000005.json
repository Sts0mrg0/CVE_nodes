It was reported (https://github.com/curl/curl/pull/2231) that reading an HTTP/2 trailer could mess up future trailers since the stored size was one byte less than required. The problem is that the code that creates HTTP/1-like headers from the HTTP/2 trailer data once appended a string like `:` to the target buffer, while this was recently changed to `: ` (a space was added after the colon) but the following math wasn't updated correspondingly. When accessed, the data is read out of bounds and causes either a crash or that the (too large) data gets passed to client write. This could lead to a denial-of-service situation or an information disclosure if someone has a service that echoes back or uses the trailers for something.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 14:43:11 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-06-18", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "https://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_2018-824a.html", "Description": "CONFIRM:https://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_2018-824a.html"}, {"URL": "https://github.com/curl/curl/pull/2231", "Description": "CONFIRM:https://github.com/curl/curl/pull/2231"}, {"URL": "https://www.debian.org/security/2018/dsa-4098", "Description": "DEBIAN:DSA-4098"}, {"URL": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:1543", "Description": "REDHAT:RHSA-2019:1543"}, {"URL": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1040273", "Description": "SECTRACK:1040273"}, {"URL": "https://usn.ubuntu.com/3554-1/", "Description": "UBUNTU:USN-3554-1"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2018-01-24"}
