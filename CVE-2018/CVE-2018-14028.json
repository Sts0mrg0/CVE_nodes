This allows for PHP files to be uploaded. Once a PHP file is uploaded, the plugin extraction fails, but the PHP file remains in a predictable wp-content/uploads location, allowing for an attacker to then execute the file. This represents a security risk in limited scenarios where an attacker (who does have the required capabilities for plugin uploads) cannot simply place arbitrary PHP code into a valid plugin ZIP file and upload that plugin, because a machine's wp-content/plugins directory permissions were set up to block all new plugins.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 14:43:25 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2018-08-14", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105060", "Description": "BID:105060"}, {"URL": "https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/44710", "Description": "MISC:https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/44710"}, {"URL": "https://github.com/rastating/wordpress-exploit-framework/pull/52", "Description": "MISC:https://github.com/rastating/wordpress-exploit-framework/pull/52"}, {"URL": "https://rastating.github.io/unrestricted-file-upload-via-plugin-uploader-in-wordpress/", "Description": "MISC:https://rastating.github.io/unrestricted-file-upload-via-plugin-uploader-in-wordpress/"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2018-08-10"}
