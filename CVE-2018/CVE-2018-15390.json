The vulnerability exists because the affected software fails to release spinlocks when a device is running low on system memory, if the software is configured to apply FTP inspection and an access control rule to transit traffic, and the access control rule is associated with an FTP file policy. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a high rate of transit traffic through an affected device to cause a low-memory condition on the device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a software panic on the affected device, which could cause the device to reload and result in a temporary DoS condition.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 14:43:30 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2018-10-07", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105519", "Description": "BID:105519"}, {"URL": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181003-ftd-inspect-dos", "Description": "CISCO:20181003 Cisco Firepower Threat Defense Software FTP Inspection Denial of Service Vulnerability"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2018-10-05"}
