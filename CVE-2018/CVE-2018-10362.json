Due to loose comparison with '==' instead of '===' in classes/Authorization.php for the user-provided login password, it is possible to login with a simpler password if the password has the form of a power in scientific notation (like '2e2' for '200' or '0e1234' for '0'). This is possible because, in the loose comparison case, PHP interprets the string as a number in scientific notation, and thus converts it to a number. After that, the comparison with '==' casts the user input (e.g., the string '200' or '0') to a number, too. Hence the attacker can login with just a '0' or a simple number he has to brute force. Strong comparison with '===' prevents the cast into numbers.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 14:43:13 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2018-04-25", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://k3research.outerhaven.de/posts/small-mistakes-lead-to-big-problems.html", "Description": "MISC:http://k3research.outerhaven.de/posts/small-mistakes-lead-to-big-problems.html"}, {"URL": "https://github.com/phpLiteAdmin/pla/issues/11", "Description": "MISC:https://github.com/phpLiteAdmin/pla/issues/11"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2018-04-25"}
