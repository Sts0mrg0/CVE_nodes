After successful authentication, the device sends an authentication cookie to the end user such that they can access the devices web administration panel. This token is hard-coded to a string in the source code (/usr/share/www/check.lp file). By setting this cookie in a browser, an attacker is able to maintain access to every ENC-400 device without knowing the password, which results in authentication bypass. Even if a user changes the password on the device, this token is static and unchanged.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 14:43:49 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-03-17", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/151802/Teracue-ENC-400-Command-Injection-Missing-Authentication.html", "Description": "MISC:http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/151802/Teracue-ENC-400-Command-Injection-Missing-Authentication.html"}, {"URL": "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2019/Feb/48", "Description": "MISC:http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2019/Feb/48"}, {"URL": "https://zxsecurity.co.nz/research.html", "Description": "MISC:https://zxsecurity.co.nz/research.html"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-03-17"}
