The vulnerability is due to a state condition between the socket state and the transmission control block (TCB) state. While this vulnerability potentially affects all TCP applications, the only affected application observed so far is the HTTP server. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending specific HTTP requests at a sustained rate to a reachable IP address of the affected software. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 14:43:10 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-01-10", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/106510", "Description": "BID:106510"}, {"URL": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190109-tcp", "Description": "CISCO:20190109 Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software TCP Denial of Service Vulnerability"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-01-09"}
