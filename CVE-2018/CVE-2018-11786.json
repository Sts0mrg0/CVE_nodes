This can be locked down a bit by using chroot to change the root directory to protect files outside of the Karaf install directory; it can be further locked down by defining a security manager policy that limits file system access to those directories beneath the Karaf home that are necessary for the system to run. However, this still allows anyone with ssh access to the Karaf process to read and write a large number of files as the Karaf process user.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 14:43:18 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2018-09-18", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://karaf.apache.org/security/cve-2018-11786.txt", "Description": "CONFIRM:http://karaf.apache.org/security/cve-2018-11786.txt"}, {"URL": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KARAF-5427", "Description": "CONFIRM:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KARAF-5427"}, {"URL": "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/5b7ac762c6bbe77ac5d9389f093fc6dbf196c36d788e3d7629e6c1d9@%3Cdev.karaf.apache.org%3E", "Description": "MLIST:[karaf-dev] 20180918 [SECURITY] New security advisory for CVE-2018-11786 released for Apache Karaf"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2018-09-18"}
