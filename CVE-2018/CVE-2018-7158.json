The code in question was replaced in Node.js 6.x and later so this vulnerability only impacts all versions of Node.js 4.x. The regular expression, `splitPathRe`, used within the `'path'` module for the various path parsing functions, including `path.dirname()`, `path.extname()` and `path.parse()` was structured in such a way as to allow an attacker to craft a string, that when passed through one of these functions, could take a significant amount of time to evaluate, potentially leading to a full denial of service.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 14:44:14 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2018-05-17", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/march-2018-security-releases/", "Description": "CONFIRM:https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/march-2018-security-releases/"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2018-05-17"}
