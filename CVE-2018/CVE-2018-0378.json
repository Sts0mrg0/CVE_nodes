The vulnerability is due to a lack of protection against PTP frame flood attacks. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending large streams of malicious IPv4 or IPv6 PTP traffic to the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition, impacting the traffic passing through the device.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 14:43:10 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2018-10-19", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105669", "Description": "BID:105669"}, {"URL": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181017-nexus-ptp-dos", "Description": "CISCO:20181017 Cisco NX-OS Software for Nexus 5500, 5600, and 6000 Series Switches Precision Time Protocol Denial of Service Vulnerability"}, {"URL": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1041920", "Description": "SECTRACK:1041920"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2018-10-17"}
