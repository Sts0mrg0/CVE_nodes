User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the processing of specially crafted pdf files with embedded u3d images. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated object. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute code in the context of the current process, a different vulnerability than CVE-2018-5677 and CVE-2018-5679.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 14:44:08 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2018-05-30", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/104300", "Description": "BID:104300"}, {"URL": "https://www.foxitsoftware.com/support/security-bulletins.php", "Description": "CONFIRM:https://www.foxitsoftware.com/support/security-bulletins.php"}, {"URL": "https://srcincite.io/advisories/src-2018-0016/", "Description": "MISC:https://srcincite.io/advisories/src-2018-0016/"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2018-05-24"}
