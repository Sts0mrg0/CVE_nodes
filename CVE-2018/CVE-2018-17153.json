An unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability to authenticate as an admin user without needing to provide a password, thereby gaining full control of the device. (Whenever an admin logs into My Cloud, a server-side session is created that is bound to the user's IP address. After the session is created, it is possible to call authenticated CGI modules by sending the cookie username=admin in the HTTP request. The invoked CGI will check if a valid session is present and bound to the user's IP address.) It was found that it is possible for an unauthenticated attacker to create a valid session without a login. The network_mgr.cgi CGI module contains a command called \"cgi_get_ipv6\" that starts an admin session -- tied to the IP address of the user making the request -- if the additional parameter \"flag\" with the value \"1\" is provided. Subsequent invocation of commands that would normally require admin privileges now succeed if an attacker sets the username=admin cookie.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 14:43:37 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2018-09-22", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105359", "Description": "BID:105359"}, {"URL": "https://securify.nl/nl/advisory/SFY20180102/authentication-bypass-vulnerability-in-western-digital-my-cloud-allows-escalation-to-admin-privileges.html", "Description": "MISC:https://securify.nl/nl/advisory/SFY20180102/authentication-bypass-vulnerability-in-western-digital-my-cloud-allows-escalation-to-admin-privileges.html"}, {"URL": "https://support.wdc.com/knowledgebase/answer.aspx?ID=25952", "Description": "MISC:https://support.wdc.com/knowledgebase/answer.aspx?ID=25952"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2018-09-18"}
