The vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of incoming TCP SYN packets to specific listening ports. The improper handling of the TCP SYN packets could cause a system file description to be allocated and not freed. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted stream of TCP SYN packets to the application. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the application to eventually restart if a file description cannot be obtained.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 14:43:10 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2018-10-07", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105282", "Description": "BID:105282"}, {"URL": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180905-cpar-dos", "Description": "CISCO:20180905 Cisco Prime Access Registrar Denial of Service Vulnerability"}, {"URL": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1041684", "Description": "SECTRACK:1041684"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2018-10-05"}
