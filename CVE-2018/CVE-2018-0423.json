The vulnerability is due to improper boundary restrictions on user-supplied input in the Guest user feature of the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious requests to a targeted device, triggering a buffer overflow condition. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to stop responding, resulting in a denial of service condition, or could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 14:43:10 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2018-10-07", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105285", "Description": "BID:105285"}, {"URL": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180905-rv-routers-overflow", "Description": "CISCO:20180905 Cisco RV110W, RV130W, and RV215W Routers Management Interface Buffer Overflow Vulnerability"}, {"URL": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1041675", "Description": "SECTRACK:1041675"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2018-10-05"}
