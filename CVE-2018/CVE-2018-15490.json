A JSON-RPC protocol over HTTP is used for communication. The JSON-RPC XVPN.GetPreference and XVPN.SetPreference methods are vulnerable to path traversal, and allow reading and writing files on the file system on behalf of the service.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 14:43:31 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-01-02", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "https://medium.com/@Wflki/https-medium-com-wflki-cve-2018-15490-expressvpn-local-privilege-escalation-d22c86fecc47", "Description": "MISC:https://medium.com/@Wflki/https-medium-com-wflki-cve-2018-15490-expressvpn-local-privilege-escalation-d22c86fecc47"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-01-02"}
