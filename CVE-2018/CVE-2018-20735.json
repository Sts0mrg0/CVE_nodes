It was found that the PatrolCli application can allow for lateral movement and escalation of privilege inside a Windows Active Directory environment. It was found that by default the PatrolCli / PATROL Agent application only verifies if the password provided for the given username is correct; it does not verify the permissions of the user on the network. This means if you have PATROL Agent installed on a high value target (domain controller), you can use a low privileged domain user to authenticate with PatrolCli and then connect to the domain controller and run commands as SYSTEM. This means any user on a domain can escalate to domain admin through PATROL Agent. NOTE: the vendor disputes this because they believe it is adequate to prevent this escalation by means of a custom, non-default configuration.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 14:43:51 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-03-18", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/46556/", "Description": "EXPLOIT-DB:46556"}, {"URL": "https://www.securifera.com/blog/2018/12/17/bmc-patrol-agent-domain-user-to-domain-admin/", "Description": "MISC:https://www.securifera.com/blog/2018/12/17/bmc-patrol-agent-domain-user-to-domain-admin/"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-01-17"}
