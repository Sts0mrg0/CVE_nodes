The vulnerability is due to incorrect processing of certain CDP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending certain CDP packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could cause an affected device to continuously consume memory and eventually result in a memory allocation failure that leads to a crash, triggering a reload of the affected device.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 14:43:10 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2018-10-07", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105398", "Description": "BID:105398"}, {"URL": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180926-cdp-memleak", "Description": "CISCO:20180926 Cisco IOS XE Software Cisco Discovery Protocol Memory Leak Vulnerability"}, {"URL": "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1041737", "Description": "SECTRACK:1041737"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2018-10-05"}
