A malicious user or attacker can craft a request to the approval endpoint that can modify the previously saved authorization request and lead to a privilege escalation on the subsequent approval. This scenario can happen if the application is configured to use a custom approval endpoint that declares AuthorizationRequest as a controller method argument. This vulnerability exposes applications that meet all of the following requirements: Act in the role of an Authorization Server (e.g. @EnableAuthorizationServer) and use a custom Approval Endpoint that declares AuthorizationRequest as a controller method argument. This vulnerability does not expose applications that: Act in the role of an Authorization Server and use the default Approval Endpoint, act in the role of a Resource Server only (e.g. @EnableResourceServer), act in the role of a Client only (e.g. @EnableOAuthClient).", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 14:43:32 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-08-08", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105687", "Description": "BID:105687"}, {"URL": "https://pivotal.io/security/cve-2018-15758", "Description": "CONFIRM:https://pivotal.io/security/cve-2018-15758"}, {"URL": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:2413", "Description": "REDHAT:RHSA-2019:2413"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2018-10-18"}
