For example, a Move module author can enter the // sequence (which introduces a single-line comment), followed by very brief comment text, the \\r character, and code that has security-critical functionality. In many popular environments, this code is displayed on a separate line, and thus a reader may infer that the code is executed. However, the code is NOT executed, because language/compiler/ir_to_bytecode/src/parser.rs allows the comment to continue after the \\r character.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:04:21 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-09-10", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "https://blog.openzeppelin.com/libra-vulnerability-release/", "Description": "MISC:https://blog.openzeppelin.com/libra-vulnerability-release/"}, {"URL": "https://blog.openzeppelin.com/libra-vulnerability-summary/", "Description": "MISC:https://blog.openzeppelin.com/libra-vulnerability-summary/"}, {"URL": "https://github.com/libra/libra/commit/7efb0221989f17fdf7f8486730898ed947a1e19e", "Description": "MISC:https://github.com/libra/libra/commit/7efb0221989f17fdf7f8486730898ed947a1e19e"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-09-10"}
