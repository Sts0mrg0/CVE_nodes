The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation for certain command strings issued on the CLI of the affected device. An attacker with write permissions for files within a readable folder on the device could alter certain definitions in the affected file. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to cause the underlying FUSE driver to execute said crafted commands, elevating the attacker's privileges to root on an affected device.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:04:23 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-05-03", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190501-apic-priv-escalation", "Description": "CISCO:20190501 Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller Privilege Escalation Vulnerability"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-05-03"}
