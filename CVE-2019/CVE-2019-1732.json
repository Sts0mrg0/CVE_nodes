The vulnerability is due to the lack of a proper locking mechanism on critical variables that need to stay static until used. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to an affected device and issuing a set of RPM-related CLI commands. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary command injection. The attacker would need administrator credentials for the targeted device.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:04:25 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-05-17", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108361", "Description": "BID:108361"}, {"URL": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190515-nxos-rpm-injec", "Description": "CISCO:20190515 Cisco NX-OS Software Remote Package Manager Command Injection Vulnerability"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-05-15"}
