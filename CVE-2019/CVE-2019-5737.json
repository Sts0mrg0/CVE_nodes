This keeps the connection and associated resources alive for a long period of time. Potential attacks are mitigated by the use of a load balancer or other proxy layer. This vulnerability is an extension of CVE-2018-12121, addressed in November and impacts all active Node.js release lines including 6.x before 6.17.0, 8.x before 8.15.1, 10.x before 10.15.2, and 11.x before 11.10.1.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:04:37 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-07-22", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20190502-0008/", "Description": "CONFIRM:https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20190502-0008/"}, {"URL": "https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/february-2019-security-releases/", "Description": "MISC:https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/february-2019-security-releases/"}, {"URL": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:1821", "Description": "REDHAT:RHSA-2019:1821"}, {"URL": "http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-03/msg00041.html", "Description": "SUSE:openSUSE-SU-2019:1076"}, {"URL": "http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-04/msg00046.html", "Description": "SUSE:openSUSE-SU-2019:1173"}, {"URL": "http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-04/msg00059.html", "Description": "SUSE:openSUSE-SU-2019:1211"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-03-28"}
