This issue is a Command Injection allowing a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code, and get a root shell. A command Injection vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary OS commands via a crafted /HNAP1 POST request. This occurs when any HNAP API function triggers a call to the system function with untrusted input from the request body for the SetNTPServerSettings API function, as demonstrated by shell metacharacters in the system_time_timezone field.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:04:47 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-03-07", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "https://github.com/lieanu/vuls/blob/master/motorola/M2_C1/SetNTPServerSettings.md", "Description": "MISC:https://github.com/lieanu/vuls/blob/master/motorola/M2_C1/SetNTPServerSettings.md"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-03-07"}
