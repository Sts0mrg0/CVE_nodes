The attacker must authenticate with valid user credentials. The vulnerability is due to the incorrect implementation of a Bash shell command that allows role-based access control (RBAC) to be bypassed. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the device and entering a crafted command at the Bash prompt. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to escalate their privilege level by executing commands that should be restricted to other roles. For example, a dev-ops user could escalate their privilege level to admin with a successful exploit of this vulnerability.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:04:20 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-03-09", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/107324", "Description": "BID:107324"}, {"URL": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190306-nx-os-bash-escal", "Description": "CISCO:20190306 Cisco NX-OS Software Bash Shell Role-Based Access Control Bypass Privilege Escalation Vulnerability"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-03-06"}
