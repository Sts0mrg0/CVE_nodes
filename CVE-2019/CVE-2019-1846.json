The vulnerability is due to the incorrect handling of certain MPLS OAM packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious MPLS OAM packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the lspv_server process to crash. The crash could lead to system instability and the inability to process or forward traffic though the device, resulting in a DoS condition that require manual intervention to restore normal operating conditions.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:04:25 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-05-17", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108363", "Description": "BID:108363"}, {"URL": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190515-asr9k-mpls-dos", "Description": "CISCO:20190515 Cisco IOS XR Software for Cisco ASR 9000 Series Aggregation Services Routers MPLS OAM Denial of Service Vulnerability"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-05-15"}
