This guess could be highly informed by a basic understanding of the symbiote/silverstripe-versionedfiles source code. (Users who upgrade from SilverStripe 3.x to 4.x and had Versioned Files installed have no further need for this module, because the 4.x release has built-in versioning. However, nothing in the upgrade process automates the destruction of these insecure artefacts, nor alerts the user to the criticality of destruction.)", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:04:22 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-09-26", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "https://www.silverstripe.org/download/security-releases/cve-2019-16409", "Description": "CONFIRM:https://www.silverstripe.org/download/security-releases/cve-2019-16409"}, {"URL": "https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-framework", "Description": "MISC:https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-framework"}, {"URL": "https://github.com/symbiote/silverstripe-versionedfiles", "Description": "MISC:https://github.com/symbiote/silverstripe-versionedfiles"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-09-26"}
