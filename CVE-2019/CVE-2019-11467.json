This has been remedied in versions 5.1.2 and 5.5.2 to ensure buffer always grows as needed for any input.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:04:06 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-09-26", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "https://www.couchbase.com/resources/security#SecurityAlerts", "Description": "MISC:https://www.couchbase.com/resources/security#SecurityAlerts"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-09-10"}
