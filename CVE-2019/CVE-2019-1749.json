The vulnerability exists because the software insufficiently validates ingress traffic on the ASIC used on the RSP3 platform. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed OSPF version 2 (OSPFv2) message to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a reload of the iosd process, triggering a reload of the affected device and resulting in a DoS condition.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:04:25 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-03-29", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/107615", "Description": "BID:107615"}, {"URL": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190327-rsp3-ospf", "Description": "CISCO:20190327 Cisco Aggregation Services Router 900 Route Switch Processor 3 OSPFv2 Denial of Service Vulnerability"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-03-27"}
