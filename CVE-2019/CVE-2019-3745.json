This issue is exploitable only during the installation of the product by an administrator. A local authenticated low privileged user potentially could exploit this vulnerability by staging a malicious DLL in the search path of the installer prior to its execution by a local administrator. This would cause loading of the malicious DLL, which would allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of an administrator.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:04:31 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-10-07", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "https://www.dell.com/support/article/SLN318889", "Description": "MISC:https://www.dell.com/support/article/SLN318889"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-10-07"}
