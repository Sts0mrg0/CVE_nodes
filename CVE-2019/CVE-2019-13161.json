A pointer dereference in chan_sip while handling SDP negotiation allows an attacker to crash Asterisk when handling an SDP answer to an outgoing T.38 re-invite. To exploit this vulnerability an attacker must cause the chan_sip module to send a T.38 re-invite request to them. Upon receipt, the attacker must send an SDP answer containing both a T.38 UDPTL stream and another media stream containing only a codec (which is not permitted according to the chan_sip configuration).", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:04:11 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-07-12", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://downloads.digium.com/pub/security/AST-2019-003.html", "Description": "CONFIRM:http://downloads.digium.com/pub/security/AST-2019-003.html"}, {"URL": "https://issues.asterisk.org/jira/browse/ASTERISK-28465", "Description": "CONFIRM:https://issues.asterisk.org/jira/browse/ASTERISK-28465"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-07-12"}
