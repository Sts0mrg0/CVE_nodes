Note: This has been disputed as a non-issue since QEMU's -qmp interface is meant to be used by trusted users. If one is able to access this interface via a tcp socket open to the internet, then it is an insecure configuration issue.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:04:11 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-07-02", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "https://fakhrizulkifli.github.io/posts/2019/06/06/CVE-2019-12929/", "Description": "MISC:https://fakhrizulkifli.github.io/posts/2019/06/06/CVE-2019-12929/"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-06-24"}
