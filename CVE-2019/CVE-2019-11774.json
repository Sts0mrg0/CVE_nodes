This can lead to a variety of different issues but read out of array bounds is one major consequence of these problems.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:04:07 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-09-12", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=549192", "Description": "CONFIRM:https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=549192"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-09-12"}
