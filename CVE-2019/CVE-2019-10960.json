Once the passcode is retrieved, an attacker must have physical access to the front panel of the printer to enter the passcode to access the full functionality of the front panel.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:04:05 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-08-20", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/advisories/icsa-19-232-01", "Description": "MISC:https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/advisories/icsa-19-232-01"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-08-20"}
