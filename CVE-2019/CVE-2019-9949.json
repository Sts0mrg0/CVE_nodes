The cgi-bin/webfile_mgr.cgi file allows arbitrary file write by abusing symlinks. Specifically, this occurs by uploading a tar archive that contains a symbolic link, then uploading another archive that writes a file to the link using the \"cgi_untar\" command. Other commands might also be susceptible. Code can be executed because the \"name\" parameter passed to the cgi_unzip command is not sanitized.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:04:50 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-05-28", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "https://community.wd.com/t/new-release-my-cloud-firmware-versions-2-31-183-05-20-2019/237717", "Description": "CONFIRM:https://community.wd.com/t/new-release-my-cloud-firmware-versions-2-31-183-05-20-2019/237717"}, {"URL": "https://bnbdr.github.io/posts/wd/", "Description": "MISC:https://bnbdr.github.io/posts/wd/"}, {"URL": "https://github.com/bnbdr/wd-rce/", "Description": "MISC:https://github.com/bnbdr/wd-rce/"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-05-23"}
