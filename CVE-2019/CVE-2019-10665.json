The scripts that handle the graphing options (html/includes/graphs/common.inc.php and html/includes/graphs/graphs.inc.php) do not sufficiently validate or encode several fields of user supplied input. Some parameters are filtered with mysqli_real_escape_string, which is only useful for preventing SQL injection attacks; other parameters are unfiltered. This allows an attacker to inject RRDtool syntax with newline characters via the html/graph.php script. RRDtool syntax is quite versatile and an attacker could leverage this to perform a number of attacks, including disclosing directory structure and filenames, file content, denial of service, or writing arbitrary files.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:04:04 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-09-09", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "https://www.darkmatter.ae/xen1thlabs/librenms-rrdtool-injection-vulnerability-xl-19-023/", "Description": "MISC:https://www.darkmatter.ae/xen1thlabs/librenms-rrdtool-injection-vulnerability-xl-19-023/"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-09-09"}
