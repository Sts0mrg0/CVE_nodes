The vulnerability is due to a failure to free system memory when an unexpected DHCP request is received. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted DHCP packet to the targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause an unexpected reload of the device.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:04:25 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-05-16", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108344", "Description": "BID:108344"}, {"URL": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190515-sb300sms-dhcp", "Description": "CISCO:20190515 Cisco Small Business 300 Series Managed Switches DHCP Denial of Service Vulnerability"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-05-15"}
