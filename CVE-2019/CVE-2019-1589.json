The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper data-protection mechanisms for disk encryption keys that are used within the partitions on an affected device hard drive. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by obtaining physical access to the affected device to view certain cleartext keys. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute a custom boot process or conduct further attacks on an affected device.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:04:20 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-05-07", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108175", "Description": "BID:108175"}, {"URL": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190501-aci-unmeasured-boot", "Description": "CISCO:20190501 Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Fabric Switches Application Centric Infrastructure Mode Unmeasured Boot Vulnerability"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-05-03"}
