The openvpn_launcher.64 binary is setuid root. This binary executes /opt/pia/openvpn-64/openvpn, passing the parameters provided from the command line. Care was taken to programmatically disable potentially dangerous openvpn parameters; however, the --route-pre-down parameter can be used. This parameter accepts an arbitrary path to a script/program to be executed when OpenVPN exits. The --script-security parameter also needs to be passed to allow for this action to be taken, and --script-security is not currently in the disabled parameter list. A local unprivileged user can pass a malicious script/binary to the --route-pre-down option, which will be executed as root when openvpn is stopped.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:04:09 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-07-11", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "https://github.com/mirchr/security-research/blob/master/vulnerabilities/PIA/CVE-2019-12578.txt", "Description": "MISC:https://github.com/mirchr/security-research/blob/master/vulnerabilities/PIA/CVE-2019-12578.txt"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-07-11"}
