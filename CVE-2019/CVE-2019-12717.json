The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of arguments passed to a specific VMAN CLI command on an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by including malicious input as the argument of an affected command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying Linux operating system with root privileges, which may lead to complete system compromise. An attacker would need valid administrator credentials to exploit this vulnerability.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:04:10 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-09-25", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190925-nxos-vman-cmd-inj", "Description": "CISCO:20190925 Cisco NX-OS Software Virtualization Manager Command Injection Vulnerability"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-09-25"}
