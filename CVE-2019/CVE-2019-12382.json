NOTE: The vendor disputes this issues as not being a vulnerability because kstrdup() returning NULL is handled sufficiently and there is no chance for a NULL pointer dereference.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:04:09 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-06-19", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108474", "Description": "BID:108474"}, {"URL": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/KLGWJKLMTBBB53D5QLS4HOY2EH246WBE/", "Description": "FEDORA:FEDORA-2019-7ec378191e"}, {"URL": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/J36BIJTKEPUOZKJNHQBUZA47RQONUKOI/", "Description": "FEDORA:FEDORA-2019-f40bd7826f"}, {"URL": "https://cgit.freedesktop.org/drm/drm-misc/commit/?id=9f1f1a2dab38d4ce87a13565cf4dc1b73bef3a5f", "Description": "MISC:https://cgit.freedesktop.org/drm/drm-misc/commit/?id=9f1f1a2dab38d4ce87a13565cf4dc1b73bef3a5f"}, {"URL": "https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/5/24/843", "Description": "MISC:https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/5/24/843"}, {"URL": "https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/87o93u7d3s.fsf@intel.com/", "Description": "MISC:https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/87o93u7d3s.fsf@intel.com/"}, {"URL": "https://salsa.debian.org/kernel-team/kernel-sec/blob/master/retired/CVE-2019-12382", "Description": "MISC:https://salsa.debian.org/kernel-team/kernel-sec/blob/master/retired/CVE-2019-12382"}, {"URL": "http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-06/msg00039.html", "Description": "SUSE:openSUSE-SU-2019:1570"}, {"URL": "http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-06/msg00040.html", "Description": "SUSE:openSUSE-SU-2019:1571"}, {"URL": "http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-06/msg00048.html", "Description": "SUSE:openSUSE-SU-2019:1579"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-05-27"}
