A v2_decoder.cpp zmq::v2_decoder_t::size_ready integer overflow allows an authenticated attacker to overwrite an arbitrary amount of bytes beyond the bounds of a buffer, which can be leveraged to run arbitrary code on the target system. The memory layout allows the attacker to inject OS commands into a data structure located immediately after the problematic buffer (i.e., it is not necessary to use a typical buffer-overflow exploitation technique that changes the flow of control).", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:04:39 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-03-28", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/issues/3351", "Description": "CONFIRM:https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/issues/3351"}, {"URL": "https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/releases/tag/v4.3.1", "Description": "CONFIRM:https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/releases/tag/v4.3.1"}, {"URL": "https://www.debian.org/security/2019/dsa-4368", "Description": "DEBIAN:DSA-4368"}, {"URL": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201903-22", "Description": "GENTOO:GLSA-201903-22"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-01-13"}
