The vulnerability exits in the function of redirection display for serial port printing information, which can not be used by product basic functions. After an attacker logs in locally, this vulnerability can be exploited to cause device restart or arbitrary code execution. Dahua has identified the corresponding security problems in the static code auditing process, so it has gradually deleted this function, which is no longer available in the newer devices and softwares. Dahua has released versions of the affected products to fix the vulnerability.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:04:49 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-06-12", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "https://www.dahuasecurity.com/support/cybersecurity/details/617", "Description": "MISC:https://www.dahuasecurity.com/support/cybersecurity/details/617"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-06-12"}
