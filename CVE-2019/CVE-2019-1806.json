Manual intervention may be required before a device resumes normal operations. The vulnerability is due to improper validation of SNMP protocol data units (PDUs) in SNMP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious SNMP packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to cease forwarding traffic, which could result in a denial of service (DoS) condition. Cisco has released firmware updates that address this vulnerability.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:04:25 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-05-16", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108335", "Description": "BID:108335"}, {"URL": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190515-sb-snmpdos", "Description": "CISCO:20190515 Cisco Small Business Series Switches Simple Network Management Protocol Denial of Service Vulnerability"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-05-15"}
