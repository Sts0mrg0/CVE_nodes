The vulnerability exists because the software improperly filters Ethernet frames sent to an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted packets to the management interface of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass the Layer 2 (L2) filters and send data directly to the kernel of the affected device. A malicious frame successfully delivered would make the target device generate a specific syslog entry.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:04:23 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-05-07", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108173", "Description": "BID:108173"}, {"URL": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190501-asa-ftd-bypass", "Description": "CISCO:20190501 Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance and Firepower Threat Defense Software Layer 2 Filtering Bypass Vulnerability"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-05-03"}
