The attacker must authenticate with valid administrator device credentials. The vulnerability is due to the incorrect implementation of a CLI command that allows a Bash command to be incorrectly invoked on the Guest Shell CLI. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the device and entering a crafted command at the Guest Shell prompt. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to issue commands that should be restricted by a Guest Shell account.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:04:25 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-05-21", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108397", "Description": "BID:108397"}, {"URL": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190515-nxos-bash-bypass", "Description": "CISCO:20190515 Cisco NX-OS Software Bash Bypass Guest Shell Vulnerability"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-05-15"}
