When using SASL authentication and session encryption, and relying on the SASL security layers in slapd access controls, it is possible to obtain access that would otherwise be denied via a simple bind for any identity covered in those ACLs. After the first SASL bind is completed, the sasl_ssf value is retained for all new non-SASL connections. Depending on the ACL configuration, this can affect different types of operations (searches, modifications, etc.). In other words, a successful authorization step completed by one user affects the authorization requirement for a different user.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:04:12 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-09-24", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "https://www.openldap.org/lists/openldap-announce/201907/msg00001.html", "Description": "CONFIRM:https://www.openldap.org/lists/openldap-announce/201907/msg00001.html"}, {"URL": "https://www.openldap.org/its/index.cgi/?findid=9052", "Description": "MISC:https://www.openldap.org/its/index.cgi/?findid=9052"}, {"URL": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2019/08/msg00024.html", "Description": "MLIST:[debian-lts-announce] 20190818 [SECURITY] [DLA 1891-1] openldap security update"}, {"URL": "http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-09/msg00053.html", "Description": "SUSE:openSUSE-SU-2019:2157"}, {"URL": "http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-09/msg00058.html", "Description": "SUSE:openSUSE-SU-2019:2176"}, {"URL": "https://usn.ubuntu.com/4078-1/", "Description": "UBUNTU:USN-4078-1"}, {"URL": "https://usn.ubuntu.com/4078-2/", "Description": "UBUNTU:USN-4078-2"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-07-26"}
