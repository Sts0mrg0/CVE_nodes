The vulnerability is due to improper handling of the XML input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) message with a crafted XML payload to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust CPU resources, resulting in a DoS condition. Manual intervention may be required to recover the device. This vulnerability is fixed in Cisco Expressway Series and Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server Releases X12.5.1 and later.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:04:24 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-04-22", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108016", "Description": "BID:108016"}, {"URL": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190417-es-tvcs-dos", "Description": "CISCO:20190417 Cisco Expressway Series and Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server Denial of Service Vulnerability"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-04-17"}
