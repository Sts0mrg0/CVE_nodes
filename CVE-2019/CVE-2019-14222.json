An unauthenticated, remote attacker could authenticate to Alfresco's Solr Web Admin Interface. The vulnerability is due to the presence of a default private key that is present in all default installations. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using the extracted private key and bundling it into a PKCS12. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain information about the target system (e.g., OS type, system file locations, Java version, Solr version, etc.) as well as the ability to launch further attacks by leveraging the access to Alfresco's Solr Web Admin Interface.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:04:14 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-09-05", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "https://github.com/DrunkenShells/Disclosures/tree/master/CVE-2019-14222-Default%20Certificate-Alfresco%20Community", "Description": "MISC:https://github.com/DrunkenShells/Disclosures/tree/master/CVE-2019-14222-Default%20Certificate-Alfresco%20Community"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-09-05"}
