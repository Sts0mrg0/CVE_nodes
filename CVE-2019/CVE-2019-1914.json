The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious request to certain parts of the web management interface. To send the malicious request, the attacker needs a valid login session in the web management interface as a privilege level 15 user. Depending on the configuration of the affected switch, the malicious request must be sent via HTTP or HTTPS. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands with the privileges of the root user.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:04:26 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-10-01", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190806-sb220-inject", "Description": "CISCO:20190806 Cisco Small Business 220 Series Smart Switches Command Injection Vulnerability"}, {"URL": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/154667/Realtek-Managed-Switch-Controller-RTL83xx-Stack-Overflow.html", "Description": "MISC:http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/154667/Realtek-Managed-Switch-Controller-RTL83xx-Stack-Overflow.html"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-08-07"}
