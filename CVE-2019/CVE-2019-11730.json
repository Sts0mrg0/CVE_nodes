The Fetch API can then be used to read the contents of any files stored in these directories and they may uploaded to a server. It was demonstrated that in combination with a popular Android messaging app, if a malicious HTML attachment is sent to a user and they opened that attachment in Firefox, due to that app's predictable pattern for locally-saved file names, it is possible to read attachments the victim received from other correspondents. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 60.8, Firefox < 68, and Thunderbird < 60.8.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:04:07 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-10-04", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201908-12", "Description": "GENTOO:GLSA-201908-12"}, {"URL": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201908-20", "Description": "GENTOO:GLSA-201908-20"}, {"URL": "https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1558299", "Description": "MISC:https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1558299"}, {"URL": "https://www.mozilla.org/security/advisories/mfsa2019-21/", "Description": "MISC:https://www.mozilla.org/security/advisories/mfsa2019-21/"}, {"URL": "https://www.mozilla.org/security/advisories/mfsa2019-22/", "Description": "MISC:https://www.mozilla.org/security/advisories/mfsa2019-22/"}, {"URL": "https://www.mozilla.org/security/advisories/mfsa2019-23/", "Description": "MISC:https://www.mozilla.org/security/advisories/mfsa2019-23/"}, {"URL": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2019/08/msg00001.html", "Description": "MLIST:[debian-lts-announce] 20190802 [SECURITY] [DLA 1869-1] firefox-esr security update"}, {"URL": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2019/08/msg00002.html", "Description": "MLIST:[debian-lts-announce] 20190802 [SECURITY] [DLA 1870-1] thunderbird security update"}, {"URL": "http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-07/msg00055.html", "Description": "SUSE:openSUSE-SU-2019:1811"}, {"URL": "http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-07/msg00058.html", "Description": "SUSE:openSUSE-SU-2019:1813"}, {"URL": "http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-08/msg00073.html", "Description": "SUSE:openSUSE-SU-2019:1990"}, {"URL": "http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-10/msg00010.html", "Description": "SUSE:openSUSE-SU-2019:2248"}, {"URL": "http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-10/msg00009.html", "Description": "SUSE:openSUSE-SU-2019:2249"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-07-23"}
