The vulnerability occurs because the affected software improperly sanitizes user-supplied input. An attacker who has valid administrator access to an affected device could exploit this vulnerability by supplying a username with a malicious payload in the web UI and subsequently making a request to a specific endpoint in the web UI. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to run arbitrary commands as the root user, allowing complete compromise of the system.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:04:25 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-03-28", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/107598", "Description": "BID:107598"}, {"URL": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190327-iosxe-cmdinject", "Description": "CISCO:20190327 Cisco IOS XE Software Command Injection Vulnerability"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-03-27"}
