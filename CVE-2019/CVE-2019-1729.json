These file overwrites by the attacker are accomplished at the root privilege level. The vulnerability occurs because there is no verification of user-input parameters and or digital-signature verification for image files when using a specific CLI command. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the device and issuing a command at the CLI. Because an exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite any file on the disk, including system files, a denial of service (DoS) condition could occur. The attacker must have valid administrator credentials for the affected device to exploit this vulnerability.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:04:25 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-05-20", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108378", "Description": "BID:108378"}, {"URL": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190515-nxos-file-write", "Description": "CISCO:20190515 Cisco NX-OS Software Arbitrary File Overwrite Vulnerability"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-05-15"}
