However, a combination of the default kubectl behavior and this new feature can cause the entire secret content to end up in metric labels, thus inadvertently exposing the secret content in metrics.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:04:24 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-10-03", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/releases/tag/v1.7.2", "Description": "MISC:https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/releases/tag/v1.7.2"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-10-03"}
