The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of user-supplied commands. An attacker who has administrator privileges and access to the network where the IPMI resides could exploit this vulnerability by submitting crafted input to the affected commands. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain root privileges on the affected device.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:04:21 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-08-21", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190821-imc-cmdinject-1634", "Description": "CISCO:20190821 Cisco Integrated Management Controller Command Injection Vulnerability"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-08-21"}
