When using the default configuration, the LAN Cache feature creates a local account FSAdminxxxxxxxxx (e.g., FSAdmin123456789) on the server that hosts the LAN Cache and all clients that are assigned to a LAN Cache. This account is placed into the local Administrators group of all clients assigned to the LAN Cache. When the assigned client is a Domain Controller, the FSAdminxxxxxxxxx account is created as a domain account and automatically added as a member of the domain BUILTIN\\Administrators group. Using the well known Pass-the-Hash techniques, an attacker can use the same FSAdminxxxxxxxxx hash from any LAN Cache client and pass this to a Domain Controller, providing administrative rights to the attacker on any Domain Controller. (Local account Pass-the-Hash mitigations do not protect domain accounts.)", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:04:15 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-10-11", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://community.kaseya.com/xsp/f/355.aspx", "Description": "MISC:http://community.kaseya.com/xsp/f/355.aspx"}, {"URL": "http://community.kaseya.com/xsp/f/355/t/24675.aspx", "Description": "MISC:http://community.kaseya.com/xsp/f/355/t/24675.aspx"}, {"URL": "https://lockstepgroup.com/blog/abusing-the-kaseya-lan-cache-fsadmin/", "Description": "MISC:https://lockstepgroup.com/blog/abusing-the-kaseya-lan-cache-fsadmin/"}, {"URL": "https://lockstepgroup.com/blog/cve-2019-14510-abusing-the-kaseya-lan-cache-fsadmin-red-team-edition/", "Description": "MISC:https://lockstepgroup.com/blog/cve-2019-14510-abusing-the-kaseya-lan-cache-fsadmin-red-team-edition/"}, {"URL": "https://www.kaseya.com/products/vsa/", "Description": "MISC:https://www.kaseya.com/products/vsa/"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-10-11"}
