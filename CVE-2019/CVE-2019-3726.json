Dell Update Package (DUP) Framework file versions prior to 3.8.3.67 used in Dell Client Platforms. The vulnerability is limited to the DUP framework during the time window when a DUP is being executed by an administrator. During this time window, a locally authenticated low privilege malicious user potentially could exploit this vulnerability by tricking an administrator into running a trusted binary, causing it to load a malicious DLL and allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim system. The vulnerability does not affect the actual binary payload that the DUP delivers.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:04:31 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-09-24", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "https://www.dell.com/support/article/SLN318693", "Description": "CONFIRM:https://www.dell.com/support/article/SLN318693"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-09-24"}
