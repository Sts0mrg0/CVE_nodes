A malicious user or attacker can craft a request to the authorization endpoint using the authorization code grant type, and specify a manipulated redirection URI via the \"redirect_uri\" parameter. This can cause the authorization server to redirect the resource owner user-agent to a URI under the control of the attacker with the leaked authorization code. This vulnerability exposes applications that meet all of the following requirements: Act in the role of an Authorization Server (e.g. @EnableAuthorizationServer) and uses the DefaultRedirectResolver in the AuthorizationEndpoint. This vulnerability does not expose applications that: Act in the role of an Authorization Server and uses a different RedirectResolver implementation other than DefaultRedirectResolver, act in the role of a Resource Server only (e.g. @EnableResourceServer), act in the role of a Client only (e.g. @EnableOAuthClient).", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:04:31 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-06-17", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/107153", "Description": "BID:107153"}, {"URL": "https://pivotal.io/security/cve-2019-3778", "Description": "CONFIRM:https://pivotal.io/security/cve-2019-3778"}, {"URL": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/153299/Spring-Security-OAuth-2.3-Open-Redirection.html", "Description": "MISC:http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/153299/Spring-Security-OAuth-2.3-Open-Redirection.html"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-03-07"}
