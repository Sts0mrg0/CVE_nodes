The vulnerability exists because the affected software improperly parses certain options in OSPF link-state advertisement (LSA) type 11 packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted LSA type 11 OSPF packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a reload of the affected device, resulting in a DoS condition for client traffic that is traversing the device.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:04:10 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-10-02", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20191002-asa-ospf-lsa-dos", "Description": "CISCO:20191002 Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance Software and Firepower Threat Defense Software OSPF LSA Processing Denial of Service Vulnerability"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-10-02"}
