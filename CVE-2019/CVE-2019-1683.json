The vulnerability is due to the improper validation of server certificates. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious server certificate to present to the client. An exploit could allow an attacker to eavesdrop on TLS-encrypted traffic and potentially route or redirect calls initiated by an affected device. Affected software include version 7.6.2 of the Cisco Small Business SPA525 Series IP Phones and Cisco Small Business SPA5X5 Series IP Phones and version 1.4.2 of the Cisco Small Business SPA500 Series IP Phones and Cisco Small Business SPA112 Series IP Phones.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:04:23 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-02-26", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/107111", "Description": "BID:107111"}, {"URL": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190220-ipphone-certs", "Description": "CISCO:20190220 Cisco SPA112, SPA525, and SPA5x5 Series IP Phones Certificate Validation Vulnerability"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-02-25"}
