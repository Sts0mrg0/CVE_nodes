The vulnerability exists because user input is not properly sanitized for certain commands at the CLI. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted commands to the CLI of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to establish an interactive session with elevated privileges. The attacker could then use the elevated privileges to further compromise the device or obtain additional configuration data from the device.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:04:22 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-01-26", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/106723", "Description": "BID:106723"}, {"URL": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190123-sdwan-escal", "Description": "CISCO:20190123 Multiple Privilege Escalation Vulnerabilities in Cisco SD-WAN Solution"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-01-24"}
