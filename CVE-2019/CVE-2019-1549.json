This was intended to include protection in the event of a fork() system call in order to ensure that the parent and child processes did not share the same RNG state. However this protection was not being used in the default case. A partial mitigation for this issue is that the output from a high precision timer is mixed into the RNG state so the likelihood of a parent and child process sharing state is significantly reduced. If an application already calls OPENSSL_init_crypto() explicitly using OPENSSL_INIT_ATFORK then this problem does not occur at all. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1d (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1c).", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:04:19 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-10-09", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/Oct/1", "Description": "BUGTRAQ:20191001 [SECURITY] [DSA 4539-1] openssl security update"}, {"URL": "https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=1b0fe00e2704b5e20334a16d3c9099d1ba2ef1be", "Description": "CONFIRM:https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=1b0fe00e2704b5e20334a16d3c9099d1ba2ef1be"}, {"URL": "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20190919-0002/", "Description": "CONFIRM:https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20190919-0002/"}, {"URL": "https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K44070243", "Description": "CONFIRM:https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K44070243"}, {"URL": "https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K44070243?utm_source=f5support&amp;utm_medium=RSS", "Description": "CONFIRM:https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K44070243?utm_source=f5support&amp;utm_medium=RSS"}, {"URL": "https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20190910.txt", "Description": "CONFIRM:https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20190910.txt"}, {"URL": "https://www.debian.org/security/2019/dsa-4539", "Description": "DEBIAN:DSA-4539"}, {"URL": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/GY6SNRJP2S7Y42GIIDO3HXPNMDYN2U3A/", "Description": "FEDORA:FEDORA-2019-d15aac6c4e"}, {"URL": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ZN4VVQJ3JDCHGIHV4Y2YTXBYQZ6PWQ7E/", "Description": "FEDORA:FEDORA-2019-d51641f152"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-09-10"}
