The vulnerability is due to an error in TCP-based packet inspection, which could cause the TCP packet to have an invalid Layer 2 (L2)-formatted header. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted TCP packet sequence to the targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:04:23 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-05-07", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108176", "Description": "BID:108176"}, {"URL": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190501-asa-ftdtcp-dos", "Description": "CISCO:20190501 Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance Software and Firepower Threat Defense Software TCP Proxy Denial of Service Vulnerability"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-05-03"}
