The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based management interface of the affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to follow a maliciously crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions on an affected system with the privileges of the user. The arbitrary actions include adding an attacker-controlled device and redirecting calls intended for a specific user. For more information about CSRF attacks and potential mitigations, see Understanding Cross-Site Request Forgery Threat Vectors. This vulnerability is fixed in software version X12.5.1 and later.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:04:24 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-04-19", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108006", "Description": "BID:108006"}, {"URL": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190417-ex-vcs-xsrf", "Description": "CISCO:20190417 Cisco Expressway Series and Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server Cross-Site Request Forgery Vulnerability"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-04-17"}
