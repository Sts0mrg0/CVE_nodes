The vulnerability is due to a logic error that occurs when the affected software processes specific EVPN routing information. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious traffic patterns into the targeted EVPN network. A successful exploit could result in a crash of the l2vpn_mgr process on Provider Edge (PE) device members of the same EVPN instance (EVI). On each of the affected devices, a crash could lead to system instability and the inability to process or forward traffic through the device, resulting in a DoS condition that would require manual intervention to restore normal operating conditions.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:04:26 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-05-16", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108342", "Description": "BID:108342"}, {"URL": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190515-iosxr-evpn-dos", "Description": "CISCO:20190515 Cisco IOS XR Software BGP MPLS-Based EVPN Denial of Service Vulnerability"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-05-15"}
