The vulnerability exists because OpenSSH mishandles the authentication process. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by attempting to connect to the device via SSH. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access the configuration as an administrative user if the default credentials are not changed. There are no workarounds available; however, if client-side certificate authentication is enabled, disable it and use strong password authentication. Client-side certificate authentication is disabled by default.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:04:26 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-05-03", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190501-scbv", "Description": "CISCO:20190501 Cisco Small Business Switches Secure Shell Certificate Authentication Bypass Vulnerability"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-05-03"}
