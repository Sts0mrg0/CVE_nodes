Exploitation of this vulnerability requires privileged access to an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in to the web-based management interface with administrator privileges and then sending a malicious request to a certain part of the interface.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:04:26 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-09-02", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/Aug/49", "Description": "BUGTRAQ:20190828 Multiple vulns in Cisco UCS Director: from unauth remote access to code execution as root"}, {"URL": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190821-imcs-ucs-cmdinj", "Description": "CISCO:20190821 Cisco Integrated Management Controller Supervisor, Cisco UCS Director, and Cisco UCS Director Express for Big Data Command Injection Vulnerability"}, {"URL": "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2019/Aug/36", "Description": "FULLDISC:20190830 Multiple vulns in Cisco UCS Director: from unauth remote access to code execution as root"}, {"URL": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/154239/Cisco-UCS-IMC-Supervisor-Authentication-Bypass-Command-Injection.html", "Description": "MISC:http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/154239/Cisco-UCS-IMC-Supervisor-Authentication-Bypass-Command-Injection.html"}, {"URL": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/154308/Cisco-UCS-Director-Unauthenticated-Remote-Code-Execution.html", "Description": "MISC:http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/154308/Cisco-UCS-Director-Unauthenticated-Remote-Code-Execution.html"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-08-21"}
