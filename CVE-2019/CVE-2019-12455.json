There is an unchecked kstrndup of derived_name, which might allow an attacker to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash). NOTE: This id is disputed as not being an issue because \u201cThe memory allocation that was not checked is part of a code that only runs at boot time, before user processes are started. Therefore, there is no possibility for an unprivileged user to control it, and no denial of service.\u201d.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:04:09 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-07-10", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20190710-0002/", "Description": "CONFIRM:https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20190710-0002/"}, {"URL": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/J36BIJTKEPUOZKJNHQBUZA47RQONUKOI/", "Description": "FEDORA:FEDORA-2019-f40bd7826f"}, {"URL": "https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/sunxi/linux.git/commit/?h=sunxi/clk-for-5.3&id=fcdf445ff42f036d22178b49cf64e92d527c1330", "Description": "MISC:https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/sunxi/linux.git/commit/?h=sunxi/clk-for-5.3&id=fcdf445ff42f036d22178b49cf64e92d527c1330"}, {"URL": "https://www.mail-archive.com/linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org/msg2010240.html", "Description": "MISC:https://www.mail-archive.com/linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org/msg2010240.html"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-05-29"}
