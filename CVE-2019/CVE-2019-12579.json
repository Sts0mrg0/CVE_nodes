The PIA Linux/macOS binary openvpn_launcher.64 binary is setuid root. This binary accepts several parameters to update the system configuration. These parameters are passed to operating system commands using a \"here\" document. The parameters are not sanitized, which allow for arbitrary commands to be injected using shell metacharacters. A local unprivileged user can pass special crafted parameters that will be interpolated by the operating system calls.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:04:09 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-07-11", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "https://github.com/mirchr/security-research/blob/master/vulnerabilities/PIA/CVE-2019-12579.txt", "Description": "MISC:https://github.com/mirchr/security-research/blob/master/vulnerabilities/PIA/CVE-2019-12579.txt"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-07-11"}
