(This only affects the DBUS_COOKIE_SHA1 authentication mechanism.) A malicious client with write access to its own home directory could manipulate a ~/.dbus-keyrings symlink to cause a DBusServer with a different uid to read and write in unintended locations. In the worst case, this could result in the DBusServer reusing a cookie that is known to the malicious client, and treating that cookie as evidence that a subsequent client connection came from an attacker-chosen uid, allowing authentication bypass.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:04:10 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-09-23", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108751", "Description": "BID:108751"}, {"URL": "https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/Jun/16", "Description": "BUGTRAQ:20190613 [SECURITY] [DSA 4462-1] dbus security update"}, {"URL": "https://www.debian.org/security/2019/dsa-4462", "Description": "DEBIAN:DSA-4462"}, {"URL": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/V2CQF37O73VH2JDVX2ILX2KD2KLXLQOU/", "Description": "FEDORA:FEDORA-2019-d5ded5326b"}, {"URL": "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201909-08", "Description": "GENTOO:GLSA-201909-08"}, {"URL": "https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2019/06/11/2", "Description": "MISC:https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2019/06/11/2"}, {"URL": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2019/06/msg00005.html", "Description": "MLIST:[debian-lts-announce] 20190614 [SECURITY] [DLA 1818-1] dbus security update"}, {"URL": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2019/06/11/2", "Description": "MLIST:[oss-security] 20190611 CVE-2019-12749: DBusServer DBUS_COOKIE_SHA1 authentication bypass"}, {"URL": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:1726", "Description": "REDHAT:RHSA-2019:1726"}, {"URL": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:2868", "Description": "REDHAT:RHSA-2019:2868"}, {"URL": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:2870", "Description": "REDHAT:RHSA-2019:2870"}, {"URL": "http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-06/msg00059.html", "Description": "SUSE:openSUSE-SU-2019:1604"}, {"URL": "http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-06/msg00092.html", "Description": "SUSE:openSUSE-SU-2019:1671"}, {"URL": "http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-07/msg00026.html", "Description": "SUSE:openSUSE-SU-2019:1750"}, {"URL": "https://usn.ubuntu.com/4015-1/", "Description": "UBUNTU:USN-4015-1"}, {"URL": "https://usn.ubuntu.com/4015-2/", "Description": "UBUNTU:USN-4015-2"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-06-11"}
