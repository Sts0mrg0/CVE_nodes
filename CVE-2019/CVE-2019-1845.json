The vulnerability is due to insufficient controls for specific memory operations. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) authentication request to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause an unexpected restart of the authentication service, preventing users from successfully authenticating. Exploitation of this vulnerability does not impact users who were authenticated prior to an attack.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:04:25 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-06-06", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108615", "Description": "BID:108615"}, {"URL": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190605-cucm-imp-dos", "Description": "CISCO:20190605 Cisco Unified Communications Manager IM&P Service, Cisco TelePresence VCS, and Cisco Expressway Series Denial of Service Vulnerability"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-06-05"}
