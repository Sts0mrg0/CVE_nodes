If the hyperlink is activated by the victim the executable target is unconditionally launched. Under Windows and macOS when processing a hyperlink target explicitly activated by the user there was no judgment made on whether the target was an executable file, so such executable targets were launched unconditionally. This issue affects: All LibreOffice Windows and macOS versions prior to 6.1.6; LibreOffice Windows and macOS versions in the 6.2 series prior to 6.2.3.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:04:49 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-05-09", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "https://www.libreoffice.org/about-us/security/advisories/cve-2019-9847/", "Description": "CONFIRM:https://www.libreoffice.org/about-us/security/advisories/cve-2019-9847/"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-05-09"}
