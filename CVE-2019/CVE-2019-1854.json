The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation on the web interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the web interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass security restrictions and access the web interface of a Cisco Unified Communications Manager associated with the affected device. Valid credentials would still be required to access the Cisco Unified Communications Manager interface.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:04:26 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-05-20", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108154", "Description": "BID:108154"}, {"URL": "https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/May/49", "Description": "BUGTRAQ:20190517 [RT-SA-2019-002] Directory Traversal in Cisco Expressway Gateway"}, {"URL": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190501-expressway-traversal", "Description": "CISCO:20190501 Cisco Expressway Series Directory Traversal Vulnerability"}, {"URL": "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2019/May/28", "Description": "FULLDISC:20190517 [RT-SA-2019-002] Directory Traversal in Cisco Expressway Gateway"}, {"URL": "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/152963/Cisco-Expressway-Gateway-11.5.1-Directory-Traversal.html", "Description": "MISC:http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/152963/Cisco-Expressway-Gateway-11.5.1-Directory-Traversal.html"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-05-03"}
