It does not sufficiently check uploaded archives for invalid data, potentially allowing non-configuration scripts to be uploaded to the server. (This attack is mitigated by the attacker needing the \"Synchronize, import, and export configuration\" permission, a permission that only trusted administrators should be given. Other preventative measures in Backdrop CMS prevent the execution of PHP scripts, so another server-side scripting language must be accessible on the server to execute code.)", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:04:16 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-08-07", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "https://backdropcms.org/security/backdrop-sa-core-2019-012", "Description": "MISC:https://backdropcms.org/security/backdrop-sa-core-2019-012"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-08-07"}
