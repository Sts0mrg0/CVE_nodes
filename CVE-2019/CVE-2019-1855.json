To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need to have valid credentials on the Windows system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of the resources loaded by the application at run time. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious DLL file and placing it in a specific location on the targeted system. The malicious DLL file would execute when the Jabber application launches. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target machine with the privileges of another user's account.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:04:26 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-07-05", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/109038", "Description": "BID:109038"}, {"URL": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190703-jabber-dll", "Description": "CISCO:20190703 Cisco Jabber for Windows DLL Preloading Vulnerability"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-07-04"}
