The attacker must authenticate with valid administrator device credentials. The vulnerability is due to incomplete error handling if a specific error type occurs during the SSH key export. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the device and entering a crafted command at the CLI. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to expose a user's private SSH key. In addition, a similar type of error in the SSH key import could cause the passphrase-protected private SSH key to be imported unintentionally.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:04:25 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-05-17", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108353", "Description": "BID:108353"}, {"URL": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190515-nxos-ssh-info", "Description": "CISCO:20190515 Cisco NX-OS Software SSH Key Information Disclosure Vulnerability"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-05-15"}
