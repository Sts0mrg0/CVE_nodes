This vulnerability is due to unsafe search paths used by the application URI that is defined in Windows operating systems. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing a targeted user to follow a malicious link. Successful exploitation could cause the application to load libraries from the directory targeted by the URI link. The attacker could use this behavior to execute arbitrary commands on the system with the privileges of the targeted user if the attacker can place a crafted library in a directory that is accessible to the vulnerable system.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:04:21 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-01-26", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/106718", "Description": "BID:106718"}, {"URL": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190123-webex-teams", "Description": "CISCO:20190123 Cisco Webex Teams URI Handler Insecure Library Loading Vulnerability"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-01-23"}
