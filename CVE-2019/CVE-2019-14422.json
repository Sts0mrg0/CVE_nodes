The Tsvncmd: URI handler allows a customised diff operation on Excel workbooks, which could be used to open remote workbooks without protection from macro security settings to execute arbitrary code. A tsvncmd:command:diff?path:[file1]?path2:[file2] URI will execute a customised diff on [file1] and [file2] based on the file extension. For xls files, it will execute the script diff-xls.js using wscript, which will open the two files for analysis without any macro security warning. An attacker can exploit this by putting a macro virus in a network drive, and force the victim to open the workbooks and execute the macro inside.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:04:15 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-08-15", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2019/Aug/7", "Description": "FULLDISC:FULLDISC 20190813 TortoiseSVN v1.12.1 - Remote Code Execution Vulnerability"}, {"URL": "https://www.vulnerability-lab.com/get_content.php?id=2188", "Description": "MISC:https://www.vulnerability-lab.com/get_content.php?id=2188"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-08-15"}
