The installer writes the file rm.exe to C:\\Windows\\Temp and then executes it. The rm.exe process then attempts to load several DLLs from its current directory. Non-admin users are able to write to this folder, so an attacker can create a malicious C:\\Windows\\Temp\\OLEACC.dll file. When an admin runs the installer, rm.exe will execute the attacker's DLL in an elevated security context.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:04:07 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-05-17", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "https://www.f-secure.com/en/web/labs_global/fsc-2019-2", "Description": "CONFIRM:https://www.f-secure.com/en/web/labs_global/fsc-2019-2"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-05-17"}
