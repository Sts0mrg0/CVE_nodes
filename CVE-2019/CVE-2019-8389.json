By default, the application runs a transfer service on port 8080, accessible by everyone on the same Wi-Fi network. An attacker can send the POST parameters downfiles and cur-folder (with a crafted ../ payload) to the download.script endpoint. This will create a MusicPlayerArchive.zip archive that is publicly accessible and includes the content of any requested file (such as the /etc/passwd file).", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:04:45 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-02-16", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "https://gist.github.com/shawarkhanethicalhacker/b98c5ac7491cf77732c793ecc468f465", "Description": "MISC:https://gist.github.com/shawarkhanethicalhacker/b98c5ac7491cf77732c793ecc468f465"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-02-16"}
