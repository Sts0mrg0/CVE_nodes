The vulnerability occurs because the affected software improperly sanitizes user-supplied input. An attacker who has valid administrator access to an affected device could exploit this vulnerability by supplying a crafted input parameter on a form in the Web UI and then submitting that form. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to run arbitrary commands on the device with root privileges, which may lead to complete system compromise.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:04:26 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-05-15", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108331", "Description": "BID:108331"}, {"URL": "https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/400865", "Description": "CERT-VN:VU#400865"}, {"URL": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190513-webui", "Description": "CISCO:20190513 Cisco IOS XE Software Web UI Command Injection Vulnerability"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-05-13"}
