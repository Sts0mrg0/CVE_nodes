The attacker would need to have valid administrator credentials. The vulnerability is due to incorrect input validation of the HTTP URL used to establish a connection to the LSC Certificate Authority (CA). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the targeted device and configuring a LSC certificate. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition due to an unexpected restart of the device.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:04:25 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-04-23", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108028", "Description": "BID:108028"}, {"URL": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190417-wlc-cert-dos", "Description": "CISCO:20190417 Cisco Wireless LAN Controller Locally Significant Certificate Denial of Service Vulnerability"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-04-17"}
