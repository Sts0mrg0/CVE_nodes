If the administrator was not authorized to perform web restores but the user was authorized to perform web restores, this would allow the administrator to impersonate the user with greater permissions. In order to exploit this vulnerability, the user would have to be an administrator with access to manage an organization with a user with greater permissions than themselves.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:04:06 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-09-18", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "https://code42.com/r/support/CVE-2019-11553", "Description": "CONFIRM:https://code42.com/r/support/CVE-2019-11553"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-07-19"}
