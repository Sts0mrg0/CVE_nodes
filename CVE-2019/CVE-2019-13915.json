First, the attacker can write code in the editor, and compile and run it approximately three times to read an arbitrary file. Second, the attacker can create a symlink, and then place the symlink into a ZIP archive. An unzip operation leads to read access, and write access (depending on file permissions), to the symlink target. Third, the attacker can import a Git repository that contains a symlink, similarly leading to read and write access.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:04:13 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-07-18", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "https://github.com/b3log/wide/issues/355", "Description": "MISC:https://github.com/b3log/wide/issues/355"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-07-18"}
