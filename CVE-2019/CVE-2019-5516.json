Exploitation of this issue requires an attacker to have access to a virtual machine with 3D graphics enabled. Successful exploitation of this issue may lead to information disclosure or may allow attackers with normal user privileges to create a denial-of-service condition on their own VM. The workaround for this issue involves disabling the 3D-acceleration feature. This feature is not enabled by default on ESXi and is enabled by default on Workstation and Fusion.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:04:36 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-04-15", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2019-0006.html", "Description": "CONFIRM:https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2019-0006.html"}, {"URL": "https://www.talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2019-0762", "Description": "MISC:https://www.talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2019-0762"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-04-15"}
