A SQL-injection vulnerability was found in openstack-ironic-inspector's node_cache.find_node(). This function makes a SQL query using unfiltered data from a server reporting inspection results (by a POST to the /v1/continue endpoint). Because the API is unauthenticated, the flaw could be exploited by an attacker with access to the network on which ironic-inspector is listening. Because of how ironic-inspector uses the query results, it is unlikely that data could be obtained. However, the attacker could pass malicious data and create a denial of service.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:04:03 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-08-15", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2019-10141", "Description": "CONFIRM:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2019-10141"}, {"URL": "https://docs.openstack.org/releasenotes/ironic-inspector/ocata.html#relnotes-5-0-2-7-origin-stable-ocata", "Description": "MISC:https://docs.openstack.org/releasenotes/ironic-inspector/ocata.html#relnotes-5-0-2-7-origin-stable-ocata"}, {"URL": "https://docs.openstack.org/releasenotes/ironic-inspector/pike.html#relnotes-6-0-3-4-stable-pike", "Description": "MISC:https://docs.openstack.org/releasenotes/ironic-inspector/pike.html#relnotes-6-0-3-4-stable-pike"}, {"URL": "https://docs.openstack.org/releasenotes/ironic-inspector/queens.html#relnotes-7-2-4-stable-queens", "Description": "MISC:https://docs.openstack.org/releasenotes/ironic-inspector/queens.html#relnotes-7-2-4-stable-queens"}, {"URL": "https://docs.openstack.org/releasenotes/ironic-inspector/rocky.html#relnotes-8-0-3-stable-rocky", "Description": "MISC:https://docs.openstack.org/releasenotes/ironic-inspector/rocky.html#relnotes-8-0-3-stable-rocky"}, {"URL": "https://docs.openstack.org/releasenotes/ironic-inspector/stein.html#relnotes-8-2-1-stable-stein", "Description": "MISC:https://docs.openstack.org/releasenotes/ironic-inspector/stein.html#relnotes-8-2-1-stable-stein"}, {"URL": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:2505", "Description": "REDHAT:RHSA-2019:2505"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-07-30"}
