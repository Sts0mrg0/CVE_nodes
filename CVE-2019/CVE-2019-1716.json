The vulnerability exists because the software improperly validates user-supplied input during user authentication. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to an affected device using HTTP and supplying malicious user credentials. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to trigger a reload of an affected device, resulting in a DoS condition, or to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the app user. Cisco fixed this vulnerability in the following SIP Software releases: 10.3(1)SR5 and later for Cisco Unified IP Conference Phone 8831; 11.0(4)SR3 and later for Cisco Wireless IP Phone 8821 and 8821-EX; and 12.5(1)SR1 and later for the rest of the Cisco IP Phone 7800 Series and 8800 Series.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:04:24 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-03-22", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190320-ip-phone-rce", "Description": "CISCO:20190320 Cisco IP Phone 7800 Series and 8800 Series Remote Code Execution Vulnerability"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-03-22"}
