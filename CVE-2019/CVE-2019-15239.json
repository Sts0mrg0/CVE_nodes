Specifically, by adding to a write queue between disconnection and re-connection, a local attacker can trigger multiple use-after-free conditions. This can result in a kernel crash, or potentially in privilege escalation. NOTE: this affects (for example) Linux distributions that use 4.9.x longterm kernels before 4.9.190 or 4.14.x longterm kernels before 4.14.139.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:04:18 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-09-24", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=7f582b248d0a86bae5788c548d7bb5bca6f7691a", "Description": "MISC:https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=7f582b248d0a86bae5788c548d7bb5bca6f7691a"}, {"URL": "https://lore.kernel.org/stable/41a61a2f87691d2bc839f26cdfe6f5ff2f51e472.camel@decadent.org.uk/", "Description": "MISC:https://lore.kernel.org/stable/41a61a2f87691d2bc839f26cdfe6f5ff2f51e472.camel@decadent.org.uk/"}, {"URL": "https://pulsesecurity.co.nz/advisories/linux-kernel-4.9-tcpsocketsuaf", "Description": "MISC:https://pulsesecurity.co.nz/advisories/linux-kernel-4.9-tcpsocketsuaf"}, {"URL": "https://salsa.debian.org/kernel-team/kernel-sec/blob/f6273af2d956a87296b6b60379d0a186c9be4bbc/active/CVE-2019-15239", "Description": "MISC:https://salsa.debian.org/kernel-team/kernel-sec/blob/f6273af2d956a87296b6b60379d0a186c9be4bbc/active/CVE-2019-15239"}, {"URL": "https://www.debian.org/security/2019/dsa-4497", "Description": "MISC:https://www.debian.org/security/2019/dsa-4497"}, {"URL": "http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-09/msg00064.html", "Description": "SUSE:openSUSE-SU-2019:2173"}, {"URL": "http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-09/msg00066.html", "Description": "SUSE:openSUSE-SU-2019:2181"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-08-20"}
