Protection was added, to address CVE-2019-9852, to avoid a directory traversal attack where scripts in arbitrary locations on the file system could be executed by employing a URL encoding attack to defeat the path verification step. However this protection could be bypassed by taking advantage of a flaw in how LibreOffice assembled the final script URL location directly from components of the passed in path as opposed to solely from the sanitized output of the path verification step. This issue affects: Document Foundation LibreOffice 6.2 versions prior to 6.2.7; 6.3 versions prior to 6.3.1.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:04:49 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-10-06", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/Sep/17", "Description": "BUGTRAQ:20190910 [SECURITY] [DSA 4519-1] libreoffice security update"}, {"URL": "https://www.libreoffice.org/about-us/security/advisories/CVE-2019-9854/", "Description": "CONFIRM:https://www.libreoffice.org/about-us/security/advisories/CVE-2019-9854/"}, {"URL": "https://www.debian.org/security/2019/dsa-4519", "Description": "DEBIAN:DSA-4519"}, {"URL": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/XQKKOIY2DMZCXJINOLIQXD2NWISDKK3N/", "Description": "FEDORA:FEDORA-2019-9627e1402e"}, {"URL": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2019/10/msg00005.html", "Description": "MLIST:[debian-lts-announce] 20191006 [SECURITY] [DLA 1947-1] libreoffice security update"}, {"URL": "http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-09/msg00067.html", "Description": "SUSE:openSUSE-SU-2019:2183"}, {"URL": "https://usn.ubuntu.com/4138-1/", "Description": "UBUNTU:USN-4138-1"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-09-06"}
