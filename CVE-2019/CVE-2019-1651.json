A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a buffer overflow condition on the affected vContainer, which could result in a DoS condition that the attacker could use to execute arbitrary code as the root user.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:04:22 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-01-25", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/106703", "Description": "BID:106703"}, {"URL": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190123-sdwan-bo", "Description": "CISCO:20190123 Cisco SD-WAN Solution Buffer Overflow Vulnerability"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-01-24"}
