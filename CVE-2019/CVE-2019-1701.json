The vulnerabilities exist because the software insufficiently validates user-supplied input on an affected device. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive browser-based information. An attacker would need administrator privileges on the device to exploit these vulnerabilities.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:04:24 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-05-06", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108152", "Description": "BID:108152"}, {"URL": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190501-asa-ftd-xss", "Description": "CISCO:20190501 Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance and Firepower Threat Defense Software WebVPN Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerabilities"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-05-03"}
