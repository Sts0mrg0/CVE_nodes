The vulnerability is due to a logic error, which may prevent ingress buffers from being replenished under specific traffic conditions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of crafted packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to consume all input buffers, which are shared between all interfaces, leading to a queue wedge condition in all active interfaces. This situation would cause an affected device to stop processing any incoming traffic and result in a DoS condition until the device is reloaded manually.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:04:24 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-05-07", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108170", "Description": "BID:108170"}, {"URL": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190501-frpwr-dos", "Description": "CISCO:20190501 Cisco Firepower Threat Defense Software Packet Processing Denial of Service Vulnerability"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-05-03"}
