An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted, malformed IP packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause an affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:04:25 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-03-29", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/107614", "Description": "BID:107614"}, {"URL": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190327-eta-dos", "Description": "CISCO:20190327 Cisco IOS XE Software Encrypted Traffic Analytics Denial of Service Vulnerability"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-03-27"}
