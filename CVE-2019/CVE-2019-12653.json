An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by establishing a TCP session and then sending a malicious TCP segment via IPv4 to an affected device. This cannot be exploited via IPv6, as the Raw Socket Transport feature does not support IPv6 as a network layer protocol.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:04:10 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-09-25", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190925-rawtcp-dos", "Description": "CISCO:20190925 Cisco IOS XE Software Raw Socket Transport Denial of Service Vulnerability"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-09-25"}
