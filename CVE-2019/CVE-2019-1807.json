The vulnerability exists due to the affected application not invalidating an existing session when a user authenticates to the application and changes the users credentials via another authenticated session. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using a separate, authenticated, active session to connect to the application through the web UI. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to maintain access to the dashboard via an authenticated user's browser session. Cisco has addressed this vulnerability in the Cisco Umbrella Dashboard.
