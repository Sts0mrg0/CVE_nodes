The vulnerability is due to an incorrect allocation of an internal interface index. An adjacent attacker with the ability to submit a crafted FCoE packet that crosses affected interfaces could trigger this vulnerability. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a packet loop and high throughput on the affected interfaces, resulting in a DoS condition. This vulnerability has been fixed in version 7.3(5)N1(1).", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:04:20 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-03-08", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/107320", "Description": "BID:107320"}, {"URL": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190306-nexus-fbr-dos", "Description": "CISCO:20190306 Cisco Nexus 5600 and 6000 Series Switches Fibre Channel over Ethernet Denial of Service Vulnerability"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-03-06"}
