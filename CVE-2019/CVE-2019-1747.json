The vulnerability is due to improper processing of SMS protocol data units (PDUs) that are encoded with a special character set. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious SMS message to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the wireless WAN (WWAN) cellular interface module on an affected device to crash, resulting in a DoS condition that would require manual intervention to restore normal operating conditions.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:04:25 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-03-28", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/107599", "Description": "BID:107599"}, {"URL": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190327-sms-dos", "Description": "CISCO:20190327 Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Short Message Service Denial of Service Vulnerability"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-03-27"}
