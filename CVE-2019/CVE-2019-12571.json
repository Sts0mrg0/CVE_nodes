When the client initiates a connection, the XML /tmp/pia-watcher.plist file is created. If the file exists, it will be truncated and the contents completely overwritten. This file is removed on disconnect. An unprivileged user can create a hard or soft link to arbitrary files owned by any user on the system, including root. This creates a denial of service condition and possible data loss if leveraged by a malicious local user.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:04:09 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-07-11", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "https://github.com/mirchr/security-research/blob/master/vulnerabilities/PIA/CVE-2019-12571.txt", "Description": "MISC:https://github.com/mirchr/security-research/blob/master/vulnerabilities/PIA/CVE-2019-12571.txt"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-07-11"}
