The vulnerability is due to a logic error that may occur under specific traffic conditions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of crafted packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to prevent the targeted service interface from receiving any traffic, which would lead to a DoS condition on the affected interface. The device may have to be manually reloaded to recover from exploitation of this vulnerability.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:04:26 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-06-21", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108853", "Description": "BID:108853"}, {"URL": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190619-staros-asr-dos", "Description": "CISCO:20190619 Cisco StarOS Denial of Service Vulnerability"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-06-19"}
