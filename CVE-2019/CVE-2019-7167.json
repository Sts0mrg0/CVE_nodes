A key-generation process, during evaluation of polynomials related to a to-be-proven statement, produced certain bypass elements. Availability of these elements allowed a cheating prover to bypass a consistency check, and consequently transform the proof of one statement into an ostensibly valid proof of a different statement, thereby breaking the soundness of the proof system. This misled the original Sprout zk-SNARK verifier into accepting the correctness of a transaction.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:04:41 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-06-11", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "http://fortune.com/2019/02/05/zcash-vulnerability-cryptocurrency/", "Description": "MISC:http://fortune.com/2019/02/05/zcash-vulnerability-cryptocurrency/"}, {"URL": "https://github.com/JinBean/CVE-Extension", "Description": "MISC:https://github.com/JinBean/CVE-Extension"}, {"URL": "https://z.cash/blog/zcash-counterfeiting-vulnerability-successfully-remediated/", "Description": "MISC:https://z.cash/blog/zcash-counterfeiting-vulnerability-successfully-remediated/"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-03-26"}
