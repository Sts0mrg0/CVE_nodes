The vulnerability is due to improper management of system memory. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious IKEv1 traffic to an affected device. The attacker does not need valid credentials to authenticate the VPN session, nor does the attacker's source address need to match a peer statement in the crypto map applied to the ingress interface of the affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust system memory resources, leading to a reload of an affected device.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:04:18 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-10-02", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20191002-asa-ftd-ikev1-dos", "Description": "CISCO:20191002 Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance Software and Firepower Threat Defense Software IKEv1 Denial of Service Vulnerability"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-10-02"}
