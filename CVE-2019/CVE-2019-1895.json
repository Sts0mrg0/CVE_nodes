The vulnerability is due to an insufficient authentication mechanism used to establish a VNC session. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by intercepting an administrator VNC session request prior to login. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to watch the administrator console session or interact with it, allowing admin access to the affected device.", "cve_name_en": "cve_name_en", "edit_time": "Sat Oct 12 16:04:26 2019", "cve_code_des_url": "", "cve_other_info": "", "modify_time": "2019-08-07", "cve_detail": "", "references": [{"URL": "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190807-nfvis-vnc-authbypass", "Description": "CISCO:20190807 Cisco Enterprise NFV Infrastructure Software VNC Authentication Bypass Vulnerability"}], "cve_repaire": "", "editor": "warcup", "add_time": "2019-08-07"}
